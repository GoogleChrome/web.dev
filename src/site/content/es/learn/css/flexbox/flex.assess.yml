    stem: The default `flex-direction` is
    options:
      - content: "`row`"
        rationale: "By default, flexbox will fit items into a row, lining them
        up at the start. With wrapping turned on, it will continue creating rows
        for children to flow within."
      - content: "`column`"
        rationale: "Setting flex-direction to column is a great way to stack
        elements, but it is not the default value."

    stem: By default, a flex container wraps children.
    options:
      - content: "true"
        rationale: "Wrapping must be enabled."
      - content: "false"
        rationale: "Use `flex-wrap: wrap` with `display: flex` to wrap children"

    stem: A flex child item appears squished, which flex property helps mitigate this?
    options:
      - content: "`flex-grow`"
        rationale: "This property describes if elements can grow beyond a basis
        size, not how it should behave under a basis."
      - content: "`flex-shrink`"
        rationale: "Yes, this property describes how to handle sizing if the
        width is going below the basis."
      - content: "`flex-basis`"
        rationale: "This provides the starting point of sizing, but not how to
        handle sizing scenarios where width goes below basis, like in a squished
        scenario."
