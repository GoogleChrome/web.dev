    stem: Which of the following selectors is worth **21 points**?
    options:
      - content: "`article > section`"
        rationale: "Elements are worth 1 point, there are 2 elements in the
        selector, making this worth **2 points**."
      - content: "`article.card.dark`"
        rationale: "Elements are worth 1 point, classes are worth 10 points, and
        with 2 classes and 1 element, that makes this selector worth **21
        points**."
      - content: "`article:hover a[href]`"
        rationale: "Elements are worth 1 point, pseudo-classes and attributes
        are worth 10 points, there are 2 points for the elements, and 20 points
        for the attributes and classes, makes this selector worth **22
        points**."
