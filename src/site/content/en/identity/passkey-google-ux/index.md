Passkeys are a simple and [secure cross-device authentication
technology](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/so-long-passwords-thanks-for-all-phish.html)
that enables creating online accounts and signing in to them without entering a
password. To log in to an account, users are simply shown a prompt to to use the
screen lock on their device, such as touching the fingerprint sensor.

Google has been working with the FIDO Alliance for years, alongside Apple and
Microsoft, to bring passkeys to the world. In 2022 we rolled out platform
support for passkeys so that
[Android](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/10/bringing-passkeys-to-android-and-chrome.html)
and
[Chrome](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/12/introducing-passkeys-in-chrome.html)
users can seamlessly sign in to apps and websites across all their devices. In
May 2023, we enabled signing in to [Google Accounts with
passkeys](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/),
bringing the security and convenience of passkeys to our users.

Google is in a unique position, as we are both working on the infrastructure for
passkeys and are one of the largest services using them. We are rolling out
passkeys for Google Accounts carefully and deliberately, so we can measure the
results and use that feedback to continue to improve the passkey infrastructure
and the Google account experience.

## Transitioning users to passkeys

Passwords have been the standard sign-in method since the advent of personalized
online experiences. How do we introduce the passwordless experience of passkeys?

Research indicates that when it comes to authentication, users value the
convenience the most. They want a smooth and fast transition to the real
experience, which only comes after signing in.

Still, the transition to passkeys requires changing muscle memory and users need
to be convinced it's worth making a switch.

The user experience of passkeys for [Google.com](http://google.com) has been
strategically designed to emphasize two principles at every step of the
authentication process: ease of use and security.

### Leading with convenience

  <figcaption>For most users, this will be the first time they see passkeys</figcaption>
</figure>

The first passkey screen users see is light and easy-to-digest.  The header is
focusing on the user benefit, saying "Simplify your sign in."

The body copy explains "With passkeys you can now use your fingerprint, face or
screen lock to verify it's really you".

The illustration is intended to ground the message in the value proposition made
by the page. The large blue primary action invites the user to proceed. "Not
now" is included as a secondary action to allow users to choose whether or not
to opt in at this time, leaving the user in control. And "Learn more" is offered
for the most curious users who would like to understand passkeys better before
proceeding. 

We explored many iterations of the pages used to introduce users to passkeys
during sign in. This included trying content that emphasized the security,
technology, and other aspects of passkeys  - yet convenience was really what
resonated most. Google's content strategy, illustration, and interaction design
demonstrates this core principle for our implementation of passkeys.

### Associating the term "passkeys" with familiar security experiences

Passkeys are a new term for most users so we are intentionally gently exposing
the users to the term to build familiarity. Guided by internal research, we are
strategically associating passkeys with security.

The word "passkey" is included throughout the sign-in flow in the less-prominent
body copy position.  It's consistently nestled amongst the familiar security
experiences that enable passkey use: fingerprint, face scan, or other device
screen lock.

Our research has shown that many users associate biometrics with security. While
passkeys don't require biometrics (a passkey can be used with a device PIN, for
example), we are leaning into the association of passkeys with biometrics to
boost user perception of passkeys' security benefits. 

The additional content behind the "Learn more" has lots of valuable information
for users, including reassurance for users that their sensitive, biometric data
stays on their personal device and is never stored or shared when creating or
using passkeys. We took this approach because most users found the convenience
aspect of passkeys appealing, but only a few took into account the biometric
element during testing. 

### Introducing passkeys when it's relevant to the user

Google's heuristics carefully determine who will see the introductory screen.
Some of the factors are whether a user has two-step verification enabled and
whether they access that account regularly from the same device.

Users who are most likely to succeed with passkeys are selected first, and over
time more users will be introduced (though, anyone can get started at
[g.co/passkeys](http://g.co/passkeys) today).

Select users are prompted to create a passkey after signing in with a username
and password. There are a few reasons we chose this point in the user journey:

* The user has just signed in, they're aware of their credentials and second
  step.
* We are confident that the user is on their device–they just signed in, so it's
  unlikely they walked away or put their device down.
* Statistically, signing in isn't always successful the first time–so a message
  around making it easier next time has tangible value.

### Positioning passkeys as an alternative to passwords and not yet a replacement

Initial user research shows that many users still want passwords as a backup
sign-in method. And not all users will have the [technology necessary to adopt
passkeys](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313?hl=en&sjid=17510595681178318776-NA).

So while the industry, Google included, is moving towards a "passwordless
future", Google is intentionally positioning passkeys as a simple and secure
**alternative** to passwords. Google's UI focuses on the benefits of passkeys
and avoids language that implies getting rid of passwords.

## The creation moment

When users choose to enroll, they'll see a browser-specific UI modal that
enables them to create a passkey.

The passkey itself is shown with the industry-aligned icon and the information
used to create it. This includes the display name (a friendly name for your
passkey, like your user's real name) and the username (a unique name on your
service–an email address can work great here). When it comes to working with the
passkeys icon, [the FIDO alliance recommends using the proven passkeys
icon](https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FIDO-Alliance-UX-Guidelines-for-Passkey-Creation-and-Sign-ins.pdf)–and
encourages making it your own with customizations.

Passkeys icon is shown consistently across the user journey to create a
familiarity with what the user will see when using or managing the passkey. The
passkey icon is never presented without context or supporting material.

  alt="When users create their passkey, they'll see this page", width="800", height="600" %}
  <figcaption>When users create their passkey, they'll see this page</figcaption>
</figure>

Above, we outlined how the user and the platform work together to create a
passkey. When the user clicks "Continue" they'll be presented with a unique UI
depending on the platform. 

With that in mind, we learned through internal research that a confirmation
screen once the passkey is created can be very helpful in terms of comprehension
and closure at this step of the process.

<figure>
{% Img

  alt="Once the passkey has been created, users will see this page", width="800", height="600" %}
  <figcaption>Once the passkey has been created, users will see this page</figcaption>
</figure>

The confirmation screen is a deliberate ‘pause' to bookend the journey of
introducing a user to passkeys and going through the process of creating one of
their own. As it is (likely) the first time a user has engaged with passkeys,
this page aims to provide clear closure to the journey. We chose a standalone
page after trying some other tools like smaller notifications, and even a
post-creation email–simply to provide a structured, stable end to end
experience. 

Once the user clicks "Continue" here, they're brought to their destination.

  alt="When users sign in again, they'll likely see this page", width="800", height="600" %}
  <figcaption>When users sign in again, they'll likely see this page</figcaption>
</figure>

## Signing in

Next time a user tries to sign in, they'll be greeted with this page. This uses
the same layout, illustration, and primary call to action to evoke the first
‘creation' experience outlined above. Once the user has made a choice to enroll
in passkeys, this page should feel familiar and they will recognize what steps
they need to take to sign in.

<figure>
{% Img
  src="image/YLflGBAPWecgtKJLqCJHSzHqe2J2/kPbCZqaBDx5AFTZyi54a.png",
  alt="The user will use this WebAuthn UI to sign in", width="800", height="600" %}
  <figcaption>The user will use this WebAuthn UI to sign in</figcaption>
</figure>

The same principle of familiarity applies here. Intentionally, this uses the
same iconography, illustration, layout and text. The text within the WebAuthn UI
is kept brief, broad, and re-usable–so everyone can use this both for
authentication and reauthentication.

## Passkeys management

Introducing a whole new page within the Google Account settings pages required
careful consideration to ensure a cohesive, intuitive, and consistent user
experience.

To achieve this, we analyzed the patterns regarding navigation, content,
hierarchy, structure, and established expectations that existed across the
Google Account.

%}

</figure>

### Describe passkeys by ecosystem

To create a high level category system that would be logical to understand we
settled on describing passkeys by
[ecosystem](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/supported-environments).
This way, a user could recognize where a passkey was created and where it is
used. Each identity provider (Google, Apple, and Microsoft) has a name for their
ecosystem, so we chose to use those (Google Password Manager, iCloud keychain,
and Windows Hello respectively).

To support this, we added additional metadata, such as when it was created, when
it was last used, and the specific OS that it was used on. In terms of user
management actions, the API only supports renaming, revoking, and creating.

Renaming allows users to assign personally meaningful names to passkeys, which
could help particular cohorts of users keep track and understand them more
easily.

Revoking a passkey doesn't delete it from the user's personal credential manager
(like Google Password Manager), but renders it unusable until it is set up
again. That's why we chose a cross, instead of a trash or delete icon, to
represent the action of revoking a passkey.

When describing the action of adding a passkey to their account, the phrase
"Create passkey" resonated better with users compared to "Add a passkey." This
is a subtle language choice to distinguish passkeys from tangible, hardware
security keys (though it should be noted that [passkeys can be stored on some
hardware security
keys](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313?hl=en&sjid=17510595681178318776-NA)).

### Providing additional content 

Internal research showed that using passkeys is a relatively seamless and
familiar experience. However as with any new technology, there are lingering
questions and concerns that will come up for some users.

How the technology works behind the screen lock, what makes it more secure, and
the most common "what if" scenarios Google came across in testing are addressed
in [Google's passkey Help Center
content](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313?hl=en&sjid=17510595681178318776-NA).
Having support content ready with launch of passkeys is critical for an easy
transition for users on any site.

### Falling back from passkeys 

Reverting to the old system is as simple as clicking "try another way" when a
user is asked to authenticate with a passkey. Additionally, exiting the WebAuthn
UI will start users on a path to try their passkey again, or sign into their
Google Account in traditional ways. 

## Conclusion

We are still in the early days of passkeys, so when designing the user
experience keep a few principles in mind:

* Introduce passkeys when it's relevant to the user    
* Highlight the benefits of passkeys
* Use opportunities to build familiarity the concept of passkeys
* Position passkeys as an alternative to passwords and not a replacement

The choices we made for passkeys for Google Accounts were informed by best
practices and internal research and we'll continue to evolve the user experience
as we gain new insights from users in the real world.
