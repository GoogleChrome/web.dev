[`react-window`](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/fixed-size) is a
library that allows large lists to be rendered efficiently.

Here's an example of a list that contains 1000 rows being rendered with
`react-window`. Try scrolling as fast you can.

{% Glitch {
  id: 'react-window-fixed',
  path: 'src/App.js',
  height: 750
} %}

## Why is this useful?

There may be times where you need to display a large table or list that contains
many rows. Loading every single item on such a list can affect performance
significantly.

**List virtualization**, or "windowing", is the concept of only rendering what
is visible to the user. The number of elements that are rendered at first is a
very small subset of the entire list and the "window" of visible content _moves_
when the user continues to scroll. This improves both the rendering and
scrolling performance of the list.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./window-diagram.jpg" alt="Window of content in a virtualized list">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Moving "window" of content in a virtualized list
  </figcaption>
</figure>

DOM nodes that exit the "window" are recycled, or immediately replaced with
newer elements as the user scrolls down the list. This keeps the number of all
rendered elements specific to the size of the window.

## react-window

`react-window` is a small, third-party library that makes it easier to
create virtualized lists in your application. It provides a number of base APIs
that can be used for different types of lists and tables.

### When to use fixed size lists

Use the `FixedSizeList` component if you have a long, one-dimensional list
of equally sized items.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';

const items = [...] // some list of items

const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
  <div style={style}>
     {/* define the row component using items[index] */}
  </div>
);

const ListComponent = () => (
  <FixedSizeList
    height={500}
    width={500}
    itemSize={120}
    itemCount={items.length}
  >
    {Row}
  </FixedSizeList>
);

export default ListComponent;
```

* The `FixedSizeList` component accepts a `height`, `width` and `itemSize` prop
  to control the size of the items within the list.
* A function that renders the rows is passed as a child to `FixedSizeList`.
  Details about the particular item can be accessed with the `index` argument
  (`items[index]`).
* A `style` parameter is also passed in to the row rendering method that
  **must** be attached to the row element. List items are absolutely positioned
  with their height and width values assigned inline, and the `style` parameter
  is responsible for this.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Do not assign `height` and `width` properties to the list or the list item with
an external CSS file. They would be ignored due to the fact that these style
attributes are applied inline.
{% endAside %}

The Glitch example shown earlier in this article shows an example of a
`FixedSizeList` component.

### When to use variable sized lists

Use the `VariableSizeList` component to render a list of items that have
different sizes. This component works in the same way as a fixed size list, but
instead expects a function for the `itemSize` prop instead of a specific value.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { VariableSizeList } from 'react-window';

const items = [...] // some list of items

const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
  <div style={style}>
     {/* define the row component using items[index] */}
  </div>
);

const getItemSize = index => {
  // return a size for items[index]
}

const ListComponent = () => (
  <VariableSizeList
    height={500}
    width={500}
    itemCount={items.length}
    itemSize={getItemSize}
  >
    {Row}
  </VariableSizeList>
);

export default ListComponent;
```

The following embed shows an example of this component.

{% Glitch {
  id: 'react-window-variable',
  path: 'src/ListComponent.js',
  height: 750
} %}

The item size function passed to the `itemSize` prop randomizes the row heights
in this example. In a real application however, there should be actual logic
defining the sizes of each item. Ideally, these sizes should be calculated based
on data or obtained from an API.

{% Aside %}
Both `FixedSizeList` and `VariableSizeList` components support horizontal lists
by using a `layout="horizontal"` prop. Take a look at the
[documentation](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/fixed-size) to see
an example.
{% endAside %}

### Grids

`react-window` also provides support for virtualizing multi-dimensional lists,
or grids. In this context, the "window" of visible content changes as the user
scrolls horizontally **and** vertically.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./window-diagram-grid.jpg" alt="Moving window of content in a virtualized grid is two-dimensional">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Moving "window" of content in a virtualized grid is two-dimensional
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Similary, both `FixedSizeGrid` and `VariableSizeGrid` components can be used
depending on whether the size of specific list items can vary.

* For `FixedSizeGrid`, the API is about the same but with the fact that heights,
  widths and item counts need to be represented for both columns and rows.
* For `VariableSizeGrid`, both the column widths and row heights can be changed
  by passing in functions instead of values to their respective props.

Take a look at the
[documentation](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/grid/fixed-size) to see
examples of virtualized grids.

{% Aside %}
  Aside from providing the base components to create efficient lists and grids,
  `react-window` also provides other capabilities such as scrolling to a
  specific item or providing an indicator when the user is scrolling. The
  [documentation](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/scrolling-indicators)
  provides examples for this.
{% endAside %}

## Lazy loading on scroll

Many websites improve performance by waiting to load and render items in a long
list until the user has scrolled down. This technique, commonly referred to as
"infinite loading", adds new DOM nodes into the list as the user scrolls past a
certain threshold close to the end. Although this is better than loading all
items on a list at once, it still ends up populating the DOM with thousands of
row entries if the user has scrolled past that many. This can lead to an
excessively large DOM size, which starts to impact performance by making style
calculations and DOM mutations slower.

The following diagram might help summarize this:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./difference-in-scrolling.jpg" alt="Difference in scrolling between a regular and virtualized list">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Difference in scrolling between a regular and virtualized list
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The best approach to solve this problem is continue to use a library like
`react-window` to maintain a small "window" of elements on a page, but to also
lazy load newer entries as the user scrolls down. A separate package,
`react-window-infinite-loader`, makes this possible with `react-window`.

Consider the following piece of code which shows an example of state that is
managed in a parent `App` component.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import ListComponent from './ListComponent';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      items: [], // instantiate initial list here
      moreItemsLoading: false,
      hasNextPage: true
    };

    this.loadMore = this.loadMore.bind(this);
  }

  loadMore() {
   // method to fetch newer entries for the list
  }

  render() {
    const { items, moreItemsLoading, hasNextPage } = this.state;

    return (
      <ListComponent
        items={items}
        moreItemsLoading={moreItemsLoading}
        loadMore={this.loadMore}
        hasNextPage={hasNextPage}
      />
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

A `loadMore` method is passed into a child `ListComponent` that contains the
infinite loader list. This is important because the infinite loader needs to
fire a callback to load more items once the user has scrolled past a certain
point.

Here's how the `ListComponent` that renders the list can look like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';
import InfiniteLoader from "react-window-infinite-loader";

const ListComponent = ({ items, moreItemsLoading, loadMore, hasNextPage }) => {
  const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
     {/* define the row component using items[index] */}
  );

  const itemCount = hasNextPage ? items.length + 1 : items.length;

  return (
    <InfiniteLoader
      isItemLoaded={index => index < items.length}
      itemCount={itemCount}
      loadMoreItems={loadMore}
    >
      {({ onItemsRendered, ref }) => (
        <FixedSizeList
          height={500}
          width={500}
          itemCount={itemCount}
          itemSize={120}
          onItemsRendered={onItemsRendered}
          ref={ref}
        >
          {Row}
        </FixedSizeList>
      )}
  </InfiniteLoader>
  )
};

export default ListComponent;
```

In here, the `FixedSizeList` component is wrapped within the `InfiniteLoader`.
The props assigned to the loader are:

* `isItemLoaded`: Method that checks whether a certain item has loaded
* `itemCount`: Number of items on the list (or expected)
* `loadMoreItems`: Callback that returns a promise that resolves to additional
  data for the list

A
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render)
is used to return a function that the list component uses in order to render.
Both `onItemsRendered` and `ref` attributes are attributes that need to be
passed in.

The following is an example of how infinite loading can work with a virtualized
list.

{% Glitch {
  id: 'react-window-infinite',
  path: 'src/ListComponent.js',
  height: 750
} %}

Scrolling down the list might feel the same, but a request is now made to
retrieve 10 users from a [random user API](https://randomuser.me/) everytime you
scroll close to the end of the list. This is all done while only rendering a
single "window" of results at at a time.

By checking the `index` of a certain item, a different loading state can be
shown for an item depending on whether a request has been made for newer entries
and the item is still loading.

For example:

```js
const Row = ({ index, style }) => {
  const itemLoading = index === items.length;

  if (itemLoading) {
      // return loading state
  } else {
      // return item
  }
};
```

## Overscanning

Since items in a virtualized list only change when the user scrolls, blank
space can briefly flash as newer entries are about to be displayed. You can
try quickly scrolling any of the previous examples in this guide to notice
this. 

To improve the user experience of virtualized lists, `react-window` allows
you to overscan items with the `overscanCount` property. This allows you to
define how many items outside of the visible "window" to render at all times.

```jsx
<FixedSizeList
  //...
  overscanCount={4}
>
  {...}
</FixedSizeList>
```

`overscanCount` works for both the `FixedSizeList` and `VariableSizeList`
components and has a default value of 1. Depending on how large a list is
as well as the size of each item, overscanning more than just one entry can
help prevent a noticeable flash of empty space when the user scrolls. However,
overscanning too many entries can affect performance negatively. The whole
point of using a virtualized list is to minimize the number of entries to what
the user can see at any given moment, so try to keep the number of overscanned
items as low as possible.

For `FixedSizeGrid` and `VariableSizeGrid`, use the `overscanColumnsCount` and
`overscanRowsCount` properties to control the number of columns and rows to
overscan respectively.

## Conclusion

If you are unsure where to begin virtualizing lists and tables in your
application, follow these steps:

1. Measure rendering and scrolling performance. This
   [article](https://addyosmani.com/blog/react-window/) shows how the [FPS
   meter](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/#analyze_frames_per_second)
   in Chrome DevTools can be used to explore how efficiently items are rendered
   on a list.
2. Include `react-window` for any long lists or grids that are affecting
   performance.
3. If there are certain features not supported in `react-window`, consider using
   [`react-virtualized`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) if you
   cannot add this functionality yourself.
4. Wrap your virtualized list with `react-window-infinite-loader` if you need to
   lazy load items as the user scrolls.
5. Use the `overscanCount` property for your lists and the 
   `overscanColumnsCount` and `overscanRowsCount` properties for your grids
   to prevent a flash of empty content. Do not overscan too many entries as
   this will affect performance negatively.
