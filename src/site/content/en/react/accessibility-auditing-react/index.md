  react-axe is a library that audits a React application and logs any
  accessibility issues to the Chrome DevTools console. eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
  is an ESLint plugin that identifies and enforces a number of accessibility
  rules directly in your JSX. Using them in combination can provide a
  comprehensive auditing approach to find and fix any accessibility concerns in
  your application.

[`react-axe`](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe) is a library that audits a
React application and logs any accessibility issues to the Chrome DevTools
console. It uses the open-source [axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)
testing library to flag any issues and their severity.

[`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) is
an ESLint plugin that identifies and enforces a number of accessibility rules
directly in your JSX. Using this in combination with a tool that tests the final
rendered DOM, such as `react-axe`, can help you find and fix any accessibility
concerns on your site.

## Why is this useful?

It is crucial to build web sites that provide every user, regardless of their
impairment or restriction, the capability to access its content. Using auditing
libraries such as `react-axe` and `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` during the
development of your React application will automatically surface any
accessibility issues as they pop up.

## Use eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y

React already supports writing accessible HTML elements within JSX syntax. For
example, you only need to use the `htmlFor` attribute instead of `for` to link a
label to a specific form element within a React component.

```html
<input id="promo" type="checkbox">
<label htmlFor="promo">Receive promotional offers?</label>
```

The
[React accessibility documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html)
covers all the nuances of handling accessibility concerns within a React
component. To make it easier to spot these issues during development, Create
React App (CRA) includes the **`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`** plugin for ESLint by
default.

To enable pre-configured linting provided by CRA:

1. Install the appropriate [ESLint plugin](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) for your code editor
2. Add a `.eslintrc.json` file to your project

```json
{
  "extends": "react-app"
}
```

{% Aside %}
  You can find more details about configuring your editor to support out-of-box
  linting in the
  [CRA documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor).
{% endAside %}

Some common accessibility issues will now show up.

To check for even more accessibility rules, modify the file to automatically
include all the recommended rules by the plugin:

```json
{
  "extends": ["react-app", "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"]
}
```

If you would like an even stricter subset of rules, switch to strict mode:

```json
{
  "extends": ["react-app", "plugin:jsx-a11y/strict"]
}
```

The project
[documentation](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y#difference-between-recommended-and-strict-mode)
provides information on the differences between recommended and strict mode.

## Use react-axe

`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` can help you easily pinpoint any accessibility issues
in your JSX, but it does not test any of the final HTML output. **`react-axe`**
is a library that does exactly this by providing a React wrapper around the
[`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) testing tool by Deque Labs.

Install the library as a development dependency to begin:

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-axe
```

You now only need to initialize the module in `index.js`:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  import('react-axe').then(axe => {
    axe.default(React, ReactDOM, 1000);
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
  });
} else {
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
}
```

A
[dynamic import](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/dynamic-import)
is used here to only load the library when it is not in production mode before
rendering and booting up the root `App` component. This ensures that it is not
unecessarily included in the final production bundle.

Now when you run the application during development, issues are surfaced
directly to the Chrome DevTools console.

A severity level is also assigned for each violation. These levels are:

* Minor
* Moderate
* Serious
* Critical

  If you would like to include accessibility testing in your unit testing
  workflow, take a look at the
  [Jest and axe integration example](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/tree/develop/doc/examples/jest_react)
  to understand how.

## Conclusion

1. If you are building a site with React, include accessibility auditing into
   your workflow early to catch problems as you build your components.
2. Use `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to add accessibility checks into your linting
   workflow. CRA already comes with it included, but switch to either the
   recommended or strict mode.
3. In addition to local development testing, include `react-axe` into your
   application to catch any issues on the final rendered DOM. Do not include it
   into your production bundle.
