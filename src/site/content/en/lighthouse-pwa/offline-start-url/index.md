If Lighthouse does not receive an HTTP 200
response when accessing a page from the `start_url`,
then either the `start_url` isn't correct,
or ths page is not accessible offline
(see also [What is network reliability and how do you measure it?](/network-connections-unreliable/)).
Lighthouse flags web apps when the start URL doesn't respond with a 200 when offline

## Recommendations

1. Check that the `start_url` in your manifest is correct [Add a web app manifest](/add-manifest/).
2. Add a service worker to your app.
4. Use the service worker to cache files locally.
4. When offline, use the service worker as a network proxy to return the locally cached version of the file.

Use what you learn in this step-by-step,
hands-on codelab to learn how to add a service
worker into your own app.
