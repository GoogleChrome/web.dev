Installability is a core requirement of [Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](/discover-installable).
By prompting users to install your PWA, you allow them to add it to their home screens.
Users who add apps to home screens engage with those apps more frequently.

A [web app manifest](/add-manifest/) includes key pieces of information
required to make your app installable.

## How the Lighthouse web app manifest audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
flags pages that don't have a [web app manifest](/add-manifest/)
that meets minimum requirements for installability:

<figure class="w-figure">
  {% Img src="image/tcFciHGuF3MxnTr1y5ue01OGLBn2/039DlaixA4drrswBzSra.png", alt="Lighthouse audit showing user can't install the web app from their home screen", width="800", height="98", class="w-screenshot" %}
</figure>

If a page's manifest doesn't include the following properties,
it will fail the audit:
- A [`short_name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/short_name)
  or [`name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/name) property
- An [`icons`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/icons)
  property that includes a 192x192&nbsp;px and a 512x512&nbsp;px icon
- A [`start_url`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/start_url) property
- A [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/display)
  property set to `fullscreen`, `standalone`, or `minimal-ui`
- A [`prefer_related_applications`](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/native)
  property set to a value other than `true`.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
A web app manifest is _necessary_ for your app to be installable,
but it isn't _sufficient_. To learn how to meet all the requirements
for installability, see the
[Discover what it takes to be installable](/discover-installable) post.

## How to make your PWA installable
Make sure your app has a manifest that meets the criteria above.
See the [Installable](/installable/) collection for more information
about creating a PWA.

## How to check that your PWA is installable

### In Chrome

When your app meets the minimum requirements for installability,
Chrome fires a `beforeinstallprompt` event
that you can use to prompt the user to install your PWA.

{% Aside 'codelab' %}
Learn how to make your app installable in Chrome
with the [Make it installable](/codelab-make-installable) codelab.
{% endAside %}

### In other browsers
Other browsers have different criteria for installation
and for triggering the `beforeinstallprompt` event.
