Progressive web apps work offline. If Lighthouse does not receive an HTTP 200
response when accessing a page while offline, then the page is not accessible
offline.
Learn more in [What is network reliability and how do you measure it?](/network-connections-unreliable/).
Lighthouse flags when the page doesn't respond with a 200 when offline:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="works-offline.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing page doesn't respond with a 200 when offline">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” Page doesn't respond with a 200 when offline
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## How this audit fails

Lighthouse emulates an offline connection using the Chrome Debugging Protocol,
and then attempts to retrieve the page using `XMLHttpRequest`.

{% include 'content/lighthouse-pwa/scoring.njk' %}

## Recommendations

1. Add a service worker to your app.
2. Use the service worker to cache files locally.
3. When offline, use the service worker as a network proxy to return the
   locally cached version of the file.

The codelab above shows you some basics on how to debug your service worker
using Chrome DevTools. For more detailed help, see the codelab dedicated to
this topic, [Debugging Service
Workers](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/debugging-service-workers).
