The [Core Progressive Web App checklist](/pwa-checklist/#core) says that a PWA
should provide a custom offline page. The [Optimial Progressive Web App checklist](/pwa-checklist/#optimal)
says that a PWA should provide an offline experience where the PWA works the same offline as
it does online (wherever network connectivity isn't strictly required).

## How the Lighthouse offline audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
flags pages that don't respond with an
[HTTP 200 response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#Successful_responses)
when offline:

  <img class="w-screenshot" src="works-offline.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing page doesn't respond with a 200 when offline">
</figure>

Lighthouse emulates an offline connection using the [Chrome Remote Debugging Protocol](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol)
and then attempts to retrieve the page using [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## How to make your PWA work offline

{% include 'content/reliable/workbox.njk' %}

1. Add a [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers) to your app.
2. Use the service worker to cache files locally.
3. When offline, use the service worker as a network proxy to return the
   locally cached version of the file.
