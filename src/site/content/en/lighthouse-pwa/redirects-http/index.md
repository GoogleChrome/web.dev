All sites should be protected with HTTPS.
See the [Does not use HTTPS](/is-on-https) post to learn why
and how to set up HTTPS on your server.

## How the Lighthouse HTTP redirection audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
flags pages that aren't redirected to HTTPS:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="redirects-http.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing that HTTP traffic isn't redirected to HTTPS">
</figure>

Lighthouse changes the page's URL to HTTP, loads the page,
and then waits for the event from the [Chrome Remote Debugging Protocol](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol)
that indicates that the page is secure.
If Lighthouse doesn't receive the event within 10&nbsp;seconds, the audit fails.

## How to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS

Once you've set up HTTPS,
make sure that all unsecure HTTP traffic to your site is redirected to HTTPS:

- Use [canonical links](/canonical) in the head of your HTML page
  to help search engines figure out the best way to get to the page.
- Configure your server to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS:
  * [nginx](https://serverfault.com/questions/67316)
  * [Apache](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16200501)
  * [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/automatic-https-rewrite/)
  * [Microsoft IIS](https://serverfault.com/q/893315)
