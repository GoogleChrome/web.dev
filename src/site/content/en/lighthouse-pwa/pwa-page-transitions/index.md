Transitions should feel snappy as you tap around, even on a slow network,
a key to perceived performance.

## Recommendations

Open the app on a simulated very slow network.
Every time you tap a link/button in the app the page should respond immediately, either by:

- Transitioning immediately to the next screen and showing a placeholder loading screen
while waiting for content from the network.
- A loading indicator is shown while the app waits for a response from the network.

If using a single-page-app (client rendered),
transition the user to the next page immediately and show a
[skeleton screen](http://hannahatkin.com/skeleton-screens/).
Use any content such as title or thumbnail already available while content loads.
