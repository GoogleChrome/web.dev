Many users of your page visit on a slow cellular network connection.
Making your page load quickly on a mobile network
helps to ensure a positive experience for your mobile users.

{% Aside 'note' %}
A fast page load on a mobile network is a baseline requirement for a site
to be considered a Progressive Web App. See the
[Core Progressive Web App checklist](/pwa-checklist/#core).

## How the Lighthouse page load speed audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
flags pages that don't load fast enough on mobile:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="load-fast-enough-for-pwa.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing page doesn't load fast enough on mobile">
</figure>

Two main metrics affect how users perceive load time:

- [First Meaningful Paint (FMP)](/first-meaningful-paint), which measures when the primary content of the page appears visually complete
- [Time to Interactive (TTI)](/interactive), which measures when the page is fully interactive

For example, if a page appears visually complete after 1&nbsp;second,
but the user can't interact with it for 10&nbsp;seconds,
users will likely perceive the page load time as 10&nbsp;seconds.

Lighthouse computes what the TTI would be on a slow 4G network connection.
If the time to interactive is more than 10&nbsp;seconds, the audit fails.
