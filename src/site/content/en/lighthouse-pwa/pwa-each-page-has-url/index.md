Ensure individual pages are deep linkable via the URLs and that URLs are unique
for the purpose of shareability on social media.

## Recommendations

- Test individual pages can be opened and directly accessed via new browser windows.
- If building a single-page app,
make sure the client-side router can re-construct app state from a given URL.
