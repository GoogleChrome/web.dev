## Why does this matter?

The Lighthouse SEO audit scans your page, tests for things that matter to search
engines, and gives you a score so you can see specific areas for improvement.
SEO matters because it's how you get more relevant users viewing your content.
If a search engine has trouble seeing your page, you're possibly missing out on
traffic sources. 

## Audit your page with Lighthouse

Run Lighthouse on a page that's representative of content that you want a search
engine to see:

1. Navigate to the **Audits** panel in DevTools.
1. Select the **SEO** checkbox.
1. Click **Run Audits** to generate a report. 

Lighthouse generates a report for your page so you can see areas where you could
improve SEO for your site. For more information, see [Discover performance
opportunities with Lighthouse.](https://web.dev/discover-performance-opportunities-with-lighthouse)

## Next steps

It's worth noting that the audit doesn't cover everything you should do to
increase visibility in search engines. You'll have to check the guidelines for
individual search engines, because they may have different requirements (for
example,
[Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/webmaster-guidelines-30fba23a),
[Google Search](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769),
[Yandex](https://webmaster.yandex.com/). 

There are also non-technical aspects that can improve visibility of your content
in search engines, such as writing in the style of your target audience. Bottom
line, make great content for the people you want to attract.
