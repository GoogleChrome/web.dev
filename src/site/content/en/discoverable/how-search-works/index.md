## What does a search engine do?

Search engines are the digital version of a librarian. They use a comprehensive
index to help find the right information for a query. Understanding the basics
of search prepares you to make your content **discoverable** for users.

## How crawlers browse the web

Crawling is like reading through all the books in the library. Before search
engines can bring any search results, they need to have as much information from
the web as possible. To do this, search engines use a crawlerâ€”a program that
travels from site to site and acts like a browser.

If a book or document is missing or damaged, the crawler can't read it. Crawlers try to
fetch each URL to determine the state of the document. If a document returns an
error status code, crawlers cannot use any of its content, and might retry the
URL at a later time. This ensures only publicly accessible documents get into
the index.

If crawlers discover a redirection status code (like 301 or 302), they follow
the redirection to a new URL and continue there. Once they get a successful
response, meaning they've found a document accessible to users, they check if
it's allowed to be crawled and then download the content.

This check includes the HTML and all content mentioned in the HTML, such as images,
videos, or JavaScript. Crawlers also extract the links from HTML documents so that
the crawler can visit the linked URLs as well. Following links is how crawlers
find new pages on the web.

Crawlers don't actively click links or buttons, but instead send URLs to a queue
to crawl them later. When accessing a new URL, no cookies, service workers or
local storage (like IndexedDB) are available.

## Building an index

After retrieving a document, the crawler hands the content to the search engine
to add it to the index. The search engine now renders and analyzes the content
to understand it. Rendering means displaying the page as a browser would
([with some limitations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/rendering)).

Search engines look at keywords, the title, links, headings, text, and many
other things. These are called **signals** which describe the content and
context of the page. Signals allow search engines to answer any given query with
the best possible page.

Search engines might find the same content at different URLs. For example a
recipe for "apple pie" might live under `/recipes/apple-pie` and under
`/recipes/1234`. To avoid indexing and showing the recipe twice, search engines
determine what the main URL should be and discard the alternative URLs showing
the same content.

## Serving the most useful results

Search engines do more work then just matching the query to keywords in the
index. To give useful results, they might consider context, alternative wording,
location of the user, and more. For example, "silicon valley" might refer to the
geographic region or the TV show. But if the query is "silicon valley cast",
results on the region aren't very helpful.

Some queries can be indirect, like "the song from pulp fiction", and search
engines need to interpret that and show  results for the music in the film. When
a user searches for something, search engines determine the most useful results
and then show them to the user. Ranking, or ordering, the pages happens based on
the query. The order can often change over time if better information becomes
available.

## Next steps: how to optimize for search engines

Now that you understand the basics of how search engines work, you may see the
value in optimizing for search engines. This is called SEO, or 'Search Engine
Optimization.' By making sure search engines can find and automatically
understand your content, you are improving the visibility of your site for
relevant searches. This can result in more interested users coming to your site.
Audit your site with Lighthouse and check the SEO results to see how well search
engines can surface your content.
