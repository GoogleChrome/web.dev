If new content is added to the page,
try to make sure that the userâ€™s focus is directed to that content
so they can take action on it.

## How to manually test

One common scenario where this matters is navigation behavior in single-page apps.

If new content, such as a dialog, is added to the page,
check that the user's focus is directed to it.

## How to fix

TBD.
