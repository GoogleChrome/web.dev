{% Banner 'caution', 'body' %}This audit has been deprecated. Check out [`[id]` attributes on active, focusable elements are not unique](/duplicate-id-active) and [ARIA IDs are not all unique](/duplicate-id-aria) instead.{% endBanner %}

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/no-duplicate-ids.njk' %}

## How the Lighthouse duplicate ID audit fails

Lighthouse flags duplicate IDs found in a page:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="duplicate-id.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing ID attributes on the page are not unique">
</figure>

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/scoring.njk' %}

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/fix-duplicate-ids.njk' %}
