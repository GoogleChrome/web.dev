Audio descriptions provide relevant information for videos that dialogue
cannot, such as facial expressions and scenes.

## How the Lighthouse video description audit fails

Lighthouse flags `<video>` elements that are missing a `<track>` element
with the attribute `kind="descriptions"`.

<!--
***Todo*** I tried very hard to get audio/video audits to fail.
But no matter what, they seem to pass
even with all sorts of errors.

## How to add audio descriptions to video elements

Add at least one track element to the `video` element
with attribute `kind="descriptions"`:

```html
<video width="300" height="200">
    <source src="marathonFinishLine.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <track src="captions_en.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="english_captions">
    <track src="audio_desc_en.vtt" kind="descriptions" srclang="en" label="english_description">
    <track src="captions_es.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="es" label="spanish_captions">
    <track src="audio_desc_es.vtt" kind="descriptions" srclang="es" label="spanish_description">
</video>
```

{% Aside 'note' %}
The example above includes both audio descriptions for visually impaired users
and captions for hearing impaired users.
Captions make video elements usable for deaf or hearing-impaired users.
See also [`<video>` elements do not contain a `<track>` element with `[kind="captions"]`](/video-caption).
