Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternate text.
Decorative elements can be ignored with an empty alt attribute.

## How the Lighthouse image alternative text audit fails

Lighthouse flags `<img>` elements that don't have `alt` attributes:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="image-alt.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing <img> elements do not have alt attributes">
</figure>

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/scoring.njk' %}

## How to add alternative text to images

Provide an `alt` attribute for every `<img>` element.
If the image fails to load,
the `alt` text is used as a placeholder
so users have a sense of what the image was trying to convey.
(See also
[Include text alternatives for images and objects](/labels-and-text-alternatives#include-text-alternatives-for-images-and-objects).)

Most images should have short, descriptive text:

```html
<img alt="Audits set-up in Chrome DevTools" src="...">
```

If the image acts as decoration and does not provide any useful content,
give it an empty `alt=""` attribute to remove it from the accessibility tree:

```html
<img src="background.png" alt="">
```

You can also use ARIA labels to describe your images, for example,
`<img aria-label="Audits set-up in Chrome DevTools" src="...">`

## Tips for writing effective `alt` text

- `alt` text should give the intent, purpose, and meaning of the image.
- Blind users should get as much information from alt text as a sighted user gets from the image.
- Avoid non-specific words like "chart", "image", or "diagram".
