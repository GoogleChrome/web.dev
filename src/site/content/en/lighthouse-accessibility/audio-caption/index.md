Captions make audio elements usable for deaf or hearing-impaired users,
providing critical information such as who is talking, what they're saying,
and other non-speech information.
Lighthouse reports any `<audio>` elements that are missing a `<track>` element
with the attribute `kind="captions"`.

***Todo*** I tried very hard to get this audit to fail.
But no matter what, it seems to pass,
even with all sorts of crazy errors.

## How to fix this problem

To fix this problem,
add at least one track element to the `audio` element
with attribute `kind="captions"`:

```html
<audio>
   <source src="favoriteSong.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
   <track src="captions_en.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="english_captions">
   <track src="captions_es.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="es" label="spanish_captions">
</audio>
```

## How this audit impacts overall Lighthouse score

Todo. I have no idea how accessibility scoring is working!
