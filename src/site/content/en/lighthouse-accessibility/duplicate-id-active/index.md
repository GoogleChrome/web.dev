Avoiding duplicate IDs for focusable controls like buttons and checkboxes
is particularly important to ensure that users can access
all of your page's functionality.

## How Lighthouse identifies focusable elements with duplicate IDs

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
flags focusable elements that have duplicate IDs:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="duplicate-id-active.png"
    alt="Lighthouse audit showing focusable elements with duplicate IDs">
</figure>

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/focusable-els.njk' %}

This audit is similar to the
[**ARIA IDs are not all unique**](/duplicate-id-aria) audit
but checks for duplicate IDs in a different set of elements.
