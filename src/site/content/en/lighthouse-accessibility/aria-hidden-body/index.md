Screen readers and other assistive technologies don't announce content that's
marked as hidden. Applying the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to your `<body>`
element hides your entire web page from assistive technology users.

## How Lighthouse identifies hidden body elements

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a>
flags pages whose `<body>` element has an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute:

## How to make your page accessible to assistive technology users

Remove the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute
from the `<body>` element of your page.

One reason developers mistakenly hide the body element is to prevent assistive
technologies from announcing the main content of a page while a
[modal dialog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#dialog_modal) is open.
However, hiding the body hides _all_ page content from assistive technology users,
including the dialog.

A better solution is to apply the `aria-hidden` attribute
to a lower-level container element while the dialog is open.
For example, this sample hides the `<main>` element,
which precedes the dialog in the HTML:

```html/6
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    â€¦
  </head>
  <body>
    <main aria-hidden="true">
      <h1>Page title</h1>
      <p>Main page content</p>
    </main>
    <div class="dialog" role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-label="Sample dialog">
      <p>Sample dialog content</p>
      <button>Close dialog</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
