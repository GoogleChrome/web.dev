Screen readers and other assistive technologies
require list items (`<li>`) to be contained
within parent `<ul>` or `<ol>` to be announced properly.

When assistive technologies come to a list,
they notify users how many items are within the list.
If you don't wrap list items in a parent list element,
assistive technologies can't set user expectations correctly.

## How this Lighthouse audit fails

Lighthouse flags list items (`<li>`) that aren't contained
in `<ul>` or `<ol>` parent elements:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="listitem.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing list item isn't contained within a parent list">
</figure>

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/scoring.njk' %}

## How to fix orphaned list items

Wrap any orphaned `<li>` elements inside a `<ul>` or `<ol>` element.
