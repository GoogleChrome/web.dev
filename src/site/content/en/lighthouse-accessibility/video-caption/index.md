Captions make video elements usable for deaf or hearing-impaired users,
providing critical information such as who is talking, what they're saying,
and other non-speech information.

## How the Lighthouse video caption audit fails

Lighthouse flags `<video>` elements that are missing a `<track>` element
with the attribute `kind="captions"`.

<!--
***Todo*** I tried very hard to get this audit to fail.
But no matter what, it seems to pass,
even with all sorts of errors.
See glitch: [meggin-accessibility-assets](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/meggin-accessibiity-assets-1).
Also worth mentioning that I ran accessibility audit
against the convert gifs to video codelab,
and the audit doesn't fail either.
We don't have the track info in the codelab,
which seems problematic as well.

## How to add captions to a video

Add at least one track element to the `video` element
with the `kind="captions"` attribute:

```html
<video width="300" height="200">
    <source src="marathonFinishLine.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <track src="captions_en.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="english_captions">
    <track src="audio_desc_en.vtt" kind="descriptions" srclang="en" label="english_description">
    <track src="captions_es.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="es" label="spanish_captions">
    <track src="audio_desc_es.vtt" kind="descriptions" srclang="es" label="spanish_description">
</video>
```

{% Aside 'note' %}
The example above includes both captions for hearing impaired users,
and audio descriptions for visually impaired users.
Audio descriptions provide context beyond dialog, such as scenery, facial expressions.
