Each ARIA `role` supports a specific subset of `aria-*` attributes
that define the state and properties of that role.
For example, the `aria-selected` attribute is used to indicate whether
elements with `option`, `tab`, or similar roles are currently selected.

If an element's ARIA attribute is invalid,
assistive technologies won't be able
to interact with it as the developer intended.

## How Lighthouse checks for invalid ARIA attributes

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a>
flags invalid ARIA attributes:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="aria-valid-attr.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing ARIA attribute has invalid value">
</figure>

Lighthouse uses the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#states_and_properties" rel="noopener">states and properties from the WAI-ARIA specification</a>
to check that all ARIA attributes are valid.
A page fails this audit
when it contains an invalid attribute.

In the example Lighthouse audit above,
the `aria-checked` attribute has been misspelled as
`aria-cheked`, making it invalid.

## How to fix invalid ARIA attributes

Refer to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#states_and_properties" rel="noopener">WAI-ARIA supported states and properties</a>
to see the full list of valid ARIA attributes.
Make sure all ARIA attributes on your page match one of the defined states or properties.
