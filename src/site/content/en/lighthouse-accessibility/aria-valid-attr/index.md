[ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)
roles and attributes help screen readers
provide missing information about an element.
For these roles and attributles to make sense,
each ARIA `role` supports a specific subset of `aria-*` attributes
(see [ARIA roles definitions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)).
Assistive technologies, like screen readers,
can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid names.
Lighthouse reports ARIA attributes with invalid values:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="aria-valid-attr.png" alt="Lighthouse: ARIA attribute has invalid value">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” ARIA attribute has invalid value

## About ARIA

The [Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification (WAI-ARIA, or just ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria)
is good for bridging areas with accessibility issues that can't be managed with native HTML.
It works by allowing you to specify attributes that modify the way an element is translated into the accessibility tree. 

Using ARIA attributes,
you can give the element the missing information so the screen reader can properly interpret it.
In order for these attributes to be effective,
they need to make sense-- you wouldn't want a screen reader
to misinform a user.

For a brief intro, see the
[Introduction to ARIA](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/).

## How Lighthouse checks for invalid attribute values

Lighthouse uses the
[WAI ARIA specification - Definition of roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)
to check accepted values for roles and attributes.

Lighthouse fails this audit,
when it finds an attribute with an invalid value.
In the example Lighthouse audit above,
the `aria-checked` attribute is undefined,
when it should be either `true` or `false`.
The audit fails since the attribute has an invalid value.

## How this audit impacts overall Lighthouse score

Todo. I have no idea how accessibility scoring is working!

## How to check attribute values are valid

To check attribute values
refer to the [WAI ARIA Definition of roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions).
Check the role definition that the attribute describes,
and then check the values for that attribute.
