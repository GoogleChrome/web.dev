Link text that is discernible, unique, and focusable
improves the navigation experience for users of screen readers
and other assistive technologies.

## How this Lighthouse audit fails

Lighthouse flags links that don't have discernible names:

<figure class="w-figure">
  {% Img src="image/tcFciHGuF3MxnTr1y5ue01OGLBn2/6enCwSloHJSyylrNIUF4.png", alt="Lighthouse audit showing links do not have discernible names", width="800", height="206", class="w-screenshot" %}
</figure>

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/scoring.njk' %}

## How to add accessible names to links

Similar to buttons,
links primarily get their accessible name from their text content.
Avoid filler words like "Here" or "Read more";
instead, put the most meaningful text into the link itself:

```html
Check out <a href="â€¦">our guide to creating accessible web pages</a>.
</html>
```
