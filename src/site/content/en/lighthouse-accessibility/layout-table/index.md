Tables used for layout purposes shouldn't include data elements:
`<th>` element, `<caption>` element or `summary` attribute.

## How this Lighthouse audit fails

Lighthouse flags layout `<table>` elements that use `<th>`, `<caption>`, or `summary`:

<!--
***Todo*** This audit doesn't seem to be failing for me. I added `role="presentation"` to a table
with `th` expecting this to fail, and it does not.

## How to make presentational tables accessible

It's simple to pass the Lighthouse audit:
remove data elements (`<th>`, `<caption>` elements or the `summary` attribute) from layout tables.

If using a table just for visual layout, and not for tabular data,
the better fix is to remove the table all together,
and use cascading style sheets (CSS) to control layout instead.
