Screen readers and other assistive technologies cannot translate non-text content.
Adding alternative text to define `<object>` elements helps
assistive technologies convey meaning to users.

## How this Lighthouse audit fails

Lighthouse flags `<object>` elements that don't have alternative text:

<!--
***Todo*** Rob's docs in accessibility recommend describing objects in the inner text.
But the Lighthouse audit implies that it is checking for `alt` text.
Need to check how this audit fails.
Also need to talk with Rob the slight inconsistencies between
Rob's doc, the audit, and recommendations in deque docs.

## How to add alternative text to `<object>` elements

Describe the object in the text content of the `<object>` element.
In the example below `2019 Web Accessibility Report` is the description
of the object.

```html
<object type="application/pdf"
    data="/report.pdf"
    width="600"
    height="400">
2019 Web Accessibility Report
</object>
```

{% Aside 'note' %}
You can also use `alt` and ARIA labels to describe object elements,
for example,
`<object type="application/pdf" data="/report.pdf alt="2019 Web Accessibility Report">`.
(See [&lt;object> elements must have alternate text](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.3/object-alt).)
{% endAside %}

## Tips for writing effective `alt` text

- As previously mentioned, describe the information contained in the embedded object.
- Alternative text should give the intent, purpose, and meaning of the object.
- Blind users should get as much information from alternative text as a sighted user gets from the object.
- Avoid non-specific words like "chart", "image", or "diagram".
