A `tabindex` value greater than 0 implies an explicit navigation ordering.
Although technically valid, this often creates frustrating experiences
for users who rely on assistive technologies.
Lighthouse reports when some elements have a `tabindex` value greater than 0:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="tabindex.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing some elements have a tabindex value greater than 0">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Some elements have a `tabindex` value greater than 0.
  </figcaption>
</figure>


## How to fix this problem

Using a `tabindex` greater than 0 is considered an anti-pattern
because screen readers navigate the page in DOM order, not tab order.
Any `tabindex` greater than 0 jumps the element to the front of the natural tab order.
This unexpected tab order can give the appearance of skipping some elements entirely.

If you have a `tabindex` greater than 0,
and you're using a native element,
remove the `tabindex` all together.
Native HTML elements such as `<button>` or `<input>`
have keyboard accessibility built-in for free.

If you're using custom interactive components,
set the `tabindex` to zero.
For example:

```html
<div tabindex="0">Focus me with the TAB key</div>
```

If you need an element to come sooner in the tab order,
it should be moved to an earlier spot in the DOM.

Todo. I have no idea how accessibility scoring is working!
