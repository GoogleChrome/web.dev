Although technically valid,
using a `tabindex` greater than `0` is considered an anti-pattern because
it shifts the affected element to the end of the
[tab order](/keyboard-access/#focus-and-the-tab-order).
This unexpected behavior can make it seem like some elements can't be accessed
via keyboard, which is frustrating for users who rely on assistive technologies.

## How the Lighthouse `tabindex` audit fails

Lighthouse flags elements that have a `tabindex` value greater than `0`:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="tabindex.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing some elements have a tabindex value greater than 0">
</figure>

{% include 'content/lighthouse-accessibility/scoring.njk' %}

## How to fix problematic `tabindex` values

If you have a `tabindex` greater than `0`,
and you're using a link or form element,
remove the `tabindex`.
HTML elements such as `<button>` or `<input>`
have keyboard accessibility built-in for free.

If you're using custom interactive components,
set the `tabindex` to `0`.
For example:

```html
<div tabindex="0">Focus me with the TAB key</div>
```

If you need an element to come sooner or later in the tab order,
it should be moved to a different spot in the DOM.
