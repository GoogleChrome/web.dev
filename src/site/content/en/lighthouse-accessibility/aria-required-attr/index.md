[ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)
roles and attributes help screen readers
provide missing information about an element.
For these roles and attributes to make sense,
each ARIA `role` supports a specific subset of `aria-*` attributes
(see [ARIA roles definitions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)).
Some ARIA roles have required attributes that describe the state of the element to screen readers.
Lighthouse reports a role's missing required states and properties:

## How Lighthouse identifies missing required states and properties

Lighthouse uses the
[WAI ARIA specification: Definition of Roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)
to check for a role's required attributes.
Any role that contains "required states and properties",
must have the required state and property defined.
Lighthouse fails this audit,
when it finds a role is missing it's required state and property.

## How this audit impacts overall Lighthouse score

Lighthouse flags this as a low severity issue.
It is important to fix, and
probably indicates a mistaken assumption in your code,
but a missing required
attribute won't break the element's role.
In the example above,
the element is still announced as a heading and assigned a default level of `2`.

## How to check for required child roles

To check for required states and properties,
refer to the [WAI ARIA Definition of roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions).
Link to the role from the specification,
and check the required states and properties.

Add the missing ARIA state or property to the given element.
