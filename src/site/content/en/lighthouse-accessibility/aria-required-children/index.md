Some ARIA roles require specific child roles.
For example, the `tablist` role must own at least one element
with the `tab` role.
If the required child roles aren't present,
assistive technologies may convey confusing information about your page,
like announcing a tab set with no tabs.

## How Lighthouse identifies missing child roles

<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a>
flags ARIA roles that don't have the required child roles:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="aria-required-children.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing ARIA role missing required child role(s)">
</figure>

Lighthouse uses the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions" rel="noopener">role definitions from the WAI-ARIA specification</a>
to check for
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#mustContain" rel="noopener">required owned elements</a>â€”that is,
required child roles.
A page fails this audit
when it contains a parent role that's missing its required child roles.

In the example Lighthouse audit above,
the `radiogroup` role requires child elements with the `radio` role.
Since there are no children with a `radio` role defined,
the audit fails.
This makes sense,
as it would be confusing to have a radio group without any radio buttons.

This issue is important to fix and may break the experience for users.
In the example above, the element may still be announced as a radio group,
but users won't know how many radio buttons it contains.

## How to add missing child roles

Refer to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions" rel="noopener">WAI-ARIA role definitions</a>
to see which child roles are required for the elements that Lighthouse flagged.
(The spec refers to required children as
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#mustContain" rel="noopener">required owned elements</a>.)
