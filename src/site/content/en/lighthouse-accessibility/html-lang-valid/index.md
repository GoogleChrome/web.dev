To ensure correct pronunciation of the page as a whole,
you must specify a valid
<a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags#question" rel="noopener">BCP 47 language</a>
for the `<html>` element.

## How the Lighthouse invalid `<html>` `lang` value audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
flags pages whose `<html>` element doesn't have a valid value
for its `lang` attribute:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="html-lang-valid.png"
    alt="Lighthouse audit showing the html element has an invalid value for its lang attribute">
</figure>

Note that the [**`<html>` element does not have a `[lang]` attribute** audit](/html-has-lang)
checks whether a `lang` attribute is present.
This audit checks whether the _value_ for that attribute is valid.
