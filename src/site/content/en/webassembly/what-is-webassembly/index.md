## Assembly language

Have you ever programmed in assembly language? In computer programming, assembly language, often referred to simply as Assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is _any_ low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.

For example, looking at the [IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures](https://software.intel.com/en-us/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-combined-volumes-1-2a-2b-2c-2d-3a-3b-3c-3d-and-4) (PDF), the [`MUL`](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mul) instruction (for **mul**tiplication) performs an unsigned multiplication of the first operand (destination operand) and the second operand (source operand), and stores the result in the destination operand. Very simplified, the destination operand is an implied operand located in register `AX`, and the source operand is located in a general-purpose register like `CX`. The result is stored again in register `AX`. Consider the following x86 code example:

```bash
mov ax, 5  ; Set the value of register AX to 5.
mov cx, 10 ; Set the value of register CX to 10.
mul cx     ; Multiply the value of register AX (5)
           ; and the value of register CX (10), and
           ; store the result in register AX.
```

For comparison, if tasked with the objective of multiplying 5 and 10, you would probably write code similar to the following in JavaScript:

```js
const factor1 = 5;
const factor2 = 10;
const result = factor1 * factor2;
```

The advantage of going the assembly route is that such low-level and machine-optimized code is way more efficient than high-level and human-optimized code. In the concrete case of course this doesn't matter, but you can imagine that for more complex operations, the difference can be significant.

Now as the name already suggests, x86 code is dependent on the x86 architecture. What if there were a way of writing assembly code that was not dependent on a specific architecture, but that would inherit the performance benefits of assembly?

## asm.js

The first step to getting there was [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/), a strict subset of JavaScript that could be used as a low-level, efficient target language for compilers. This sub-language effectively described a sandboxed virtual machine for memory-unsafe languages like C or C++. A combination of static and dynamic validation allowed JavaScript engines to employ an ahead-of-time (AOT) optimizing compilation strategy for valid asm.js code. Code written in statically-typed languages with manual memory management (such as C) was translated by a source-to-source compiler such as the [early emscripten](https://web.archive.org/web/20130420191339/http://kripken.github.io/mloc_emscripten_talk/) (based on LLVM).

Performance was improved by limiting language features to those amenable to AOT. Firefox&nbsp;22 was the first browser to [support asm.js](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/22.0/releasenotes/), released under the name [OdinMonkey](https://blog.mozilla.org/luke/2013/03/21/asm-js-in-firefox-nightly/). Chrome added [asm.js support](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-61#asm.js-is-now-validated-and-compiled-to-webassembly) in version&nbsp;61. While technically asm.js still works, I wrote this paragraph in the past tense because it has been superseded by something even better: WebAssembly. (Actually, asm.js is still considered a viable alternative for browsers that don't support WebAssembly or have it disabled.)

## WebAssembly

WebAssembly is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++ and Rust, and many more with a compilation target so that they run on the web. Support for memory-managed languages such as Java, Kotlin, and Dart is in the works and should become available soon. WebAssembly is designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.

Apart from the browser, WebAssembly programs also run in other runtimes thanks to [WASI](https://wasi.dev/), the WebAssembly System Interface, a modular system interface for WebAssembly. WASI is created to be portable across operating systems, with the objective of being secure and the ability to run in a sandboxed environment.

WebAssembly code (binary code, i.e., bytecode) is intended to be run on a portable virtual stack machine (VM). The bytecode is designed to be faster to parse and execute than JavaScript and to have a compact code representation.

Conceptual execution of instructions proceeds by way of a traditional program counter that advances through the instructions. In practice, most Wasm engines compile the Wasm bytecode to machine code, and then execute that. Instructions fall into two categories:

- **Control instructions** that form control constructs and pop their argument value(s) off the stack, may change the program counter, and push result value(s) onto the stack.
- **Simple instructions** that pop their argument value(s) from the stack, apply an operator to the values, and then push the result value(s) onto the stack, followed by an implicit advancement of the program counter.

Going back to the example before, the following WebAssembly code would be equivalent to the x86 code from the beginning of the article:

```bash
i32.const 5  ; Push the integer value 5 onto the stack.
i32.const 10 ; Push the integer value 10 onto the stack.
i32.mul      ; Pop the two most recent items on the stack,
             ; multiply them, and push the result onto the stack.
```

While asm.js was implemented all in software, WebAssembly required new functionality that all browser vendors agreed on. [Announced in 2015](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/150) and first released in March 2017, WebAssembly became a [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/) on December&nbsp;5, 2019. The W3C maintains the standard with contributions from all major browser vendors and other interested parties. Since 2017, browser support is universal.

{% BrowserCompat 'javascript.builtins.WebAssembly' %}

WebAssembly has two representations: [textual](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) and [binary](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/WebAssembly/Text_format_to_wasm). What you see above is the textual representation.

### Textual representation

The textual representation is based on [S-expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format#s-expressions) and commonly uses the file extension `.wat` (for **W**eb**A**ssembly **t**ext format). If you really, really wanted to, you could write it by hand. Taking the multiplication example from above and making it more useful by no longer hardcoding the factors, you can probably make sense of the following code:

```bash
(module
  (func $mul (param $factor1 i32) (param $factor2 i32) (result i32)
    local.get $factor1
    local.get $factor2
    i32.mul)
  (export "mul" (func $mul))
)
```

### Binary representation

The binary format that uses the file extension `.wasm` is not meant for human consumption, let alone human creation. Using a tool like [wat2wasm](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wat2wasm/), you can convert the above code to the following binary representation. (The comments are not usually part of the binary representation, but added by the wat2wasm tool for better understandability.)

### Compiling to WebAssembly

As you see, neither `.wat` nor `.wasm` are particularly very human-friendly. This is where [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) comes into play.
It lets you compile from higher-level languages like C, C++, Rust, and many more to WebAssembly. Consider the following C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Usually, you would compile this C program with the compiler `gcc`.

```bash
$ gcc hello.c -o hello
```

With [emscripten installed](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html), you compile it to WebAssembly using the `emcc` command and almost the same arguments:

```bash
$ emcc hello.c -o hello.html
```

This will create a `hello.wasm` file and the HTML wrapper file `hello.html`. When you serve the file `hello.html` from a web server, you will see `"Hello World"` printed to the DevTools console.

There's also a way to compile to WebAssembly without the HTML wrapper:

```bash
$ emcc hello.c -o hello.js
```

As before, this will create a `hello.wasm` file, but this time a `hello.js` file instead of the HTML wrapper. To test, you run the resulting JavaScript file `hello.js` with, for example, Node.js:

```bash
$ node hello.js
Hello World
```

### Learn more

This brief introduction to WebAssembly is just the tip of the iceberg.
Learn more about WebAssembly in the [WebAssembly documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/WebAssembly) on MDN
and consult the [emscripten documentation](https://emscripten.org/docs/index.html). Truth be told, working with WebAssembly can feel a bit like the [How to draw an owl meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl), especially since web developers familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are not necessarily versed in the to-be-compiled-from languages like C. Luckily there are channels like [StackOverflow's `webassembly` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webassembly) where experts are often happy to help if you ask nicely.

{% Aside %}
Move on to the article [Compiling `mkbitmap` to WebAssembly](/compiling-mkbitmap-to-webassembly/) for a beginner-friendly introduction to compiling a not completely trivial but also not overly complex C program to WebAssembly. At the example of [`mkbitmap`](https://potrace.sourceforge.net/mkbitmap.1.html), this article shows how to use a Wasm program as a library in JavaScript that works with files as input and that outputs images.
