The Opportunities section of your Lighthouse report lists
all offscreen or hidden images in your page
along with the potential savings in [kibibytes (KiB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte).
Consider lazy-loading these images
after all critical resources have finished loading
to lower [Time to Interactive](/interactive):

## Stack-specific guidance

### AMP

Automatically lazy-load images with [`amp-img`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-img/).
See the [Images](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/media_iframes_3p/#images)
guide.

### Drupal

Install [a Drupal module][drupal] that can lazy load images. Such modules
provide the ability to defer any offscreen images to improve performance.

### Joomla

Install a [lazy-load Joomla
plugin](https://extensions.joomla.org/instant-search/?jed_live%5Bquery%5D=lazy%20loading)
that provides the ability to defer any offscreen images, or switch to a template
that provides that functionality. Starting with Joomla 4.0, a dedicated
lazy-loading plugin can be enabled by using the "Content - Lazy Loading Images"
plugin. Also consider using [an AMP
plugin](https://extensions.joomla.org/instant-search/?jed_live%5Bquery%5D=amp).

### Magento

Consider modifying your product and catalog templates to make use of the web
platform's [lazy loading](/native-lazy-loading) feature.

### WordPress

Install a [lazy-load WordPress
plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/lazy+load/) that provides the
ability to defer any offscreen images, or switch to a theme that provides that
functionality. Also consider using [the AMP
plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/).
