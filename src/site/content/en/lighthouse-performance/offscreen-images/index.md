The Opportunities section of your Lighthouse report lists
all offscreen or hidden images in your page
along with the potential savings in kilobytes (KB).
Consider lazy-loading these images
after all critical resources have finished loading
to lower [Time to Interactive](/interactive):

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="offscreen-images.png" alt="A screenshot of the Lighthouse Defer offscreen images audit">
</figure>
