The Opportunities section of your Lighthouse report lists
all offscreen or hidden images in your page
along with the potential savings in kilobytes (KB).
Consider lazy-loading these images
after all critical resources have finished loading
to lower [Time to Interactive](/interactive):

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="offscreen-images.png" alt="Defer offscreen images">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” Defer offscreen images
  </figcaption>
</figure>
