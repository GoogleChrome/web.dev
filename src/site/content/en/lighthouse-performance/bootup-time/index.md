When your JavaScript takes a long time to execute,
it slows down your page performance in several ways:

- **Network cost**

  More bytes equals longer download times.

- **Parse and compile cost**

  JavaScript gets parsed and compiled on the main thread.
  When the main thread is busy, the page can't respond to user input.

- **Execution cost**

  JavaScript is also executed on the main thread.
  If your page runs a lot of code before it's really needed,
  that also delays your [Time To Interactive](/interactive),
  which is one of the key metrics related to how users perceive your page speed.

- **Memory cost**

  If your JavaScript holds on to a lot of references,
  it can potentially consume a lot of memory.
  Pages appear janky or slow when they consume a lot of memory.
  Memory leaks can cause your page to freeze up completely.

## How the Lighthouse JavaScript execution time audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
shows a warning when JavaScript execution takes longer than 2&nbsp;seconds.
The audit fails when execution takes longer than 3.5&nbsp;seconds:

To help you identify the biggest contributors to execution time,
Lighthouse reports the time spent executing, evaluating, and parsing
each JavaScript file that your page loads.
