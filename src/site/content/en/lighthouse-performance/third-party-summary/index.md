To add an advertising network, social media button, A/B test, or analytics service to your page,
you usually need to add a third-party script to your HTML. These [third-party scripts can
significantly affect your page load performance](/third-party-javascript/).

## How the Lighthouse audit for third-party code fails

Lighthouse flags pages that have third-party code that blocks the [main thread] for 250&nbsp;ms or
longer:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="third-party-summary.png"
       alt="A screenshot of the Lighthouse Reduce the impact of third-party code audit">
</figure>

A third-party script is any script hosted on a domain that's different than the domain of the URL
that you audited with Lighthouse. As the page loads, Lighthouse calculates how long each of the
third-party scripts blocks the main thread. If the total blocking time is greater than 250&nbsp;ms
the audit fails.

## How to reduce the impact of third-party code

See [Identify slow third-party scripts](/identify-slow-third-party-javascript/) to learn how to use
Chrome DevTools and other Lighthouse audits to detect problematic third-party code, and
see [Efficiently load third-party JavaScript](/efficiently-load-third-party-javascript/) for
optimization strategies.
