Minifying JavaScript files can reduce payload sizes and script parse time.
The Opportunities section of your Lighthouse report lists
all unminified JavaScript files,
along with the potential savings in [kibibytes (KiB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte)
when these files are minified:

## How to minify your JavaScript files

Minification is the process of removing whitespace and any code that is not necessary
to create a smaller but perfectly valid code file.
[Terser](https://github.com/terser-js/terser) is a popular JavaScript compression tool.
webpack v4 includes a plugin for this library by default to create minified build files.
