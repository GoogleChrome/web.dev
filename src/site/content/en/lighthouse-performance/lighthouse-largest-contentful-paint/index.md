Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is one of the metrics
tracked in the **Performance** section of the Lighthouse report.
Each metric captures some aspect of page load speed.

Lighthouse displays LCP in seconds:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="largest-contentful-paint.png"
       alt="A screenshot of the Lighthouse Largest Contentful Paint audit">
</figure>

## What LCP measures

LCP measures when the largest content element in the viewport is
rendered to the screen. This approximates when the main content of the page is
visible to users. See [Largest Contentful Paint defined][definition] for more
details on how LCP is determined.

## How Lighthouse determines your LCP score

Browser support for LCP launched in [Chrome 77][launch]. Lighthouse extracts LCP data from
[Chrome's tracing tool](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool).

The table below shows how to interpret your LCP score:

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>LCP time<br>(in seconds)</th>
        <th>Color-coding</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0-2</td>
        <td>Green (fast)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2.5-4</td>
        <td>Orange (moderate)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Over 4</td>
        <td>Red (slow)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
