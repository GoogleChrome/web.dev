Lighthouse shows a breakdown of execution timings on the main thread
in the Diagnostics section:

## How to improve execution timings on the main thread

Consider these tactics to reduce time spent parsing, compiling,
and executing JS:

- [Reduce JavaScript payloads with code splitting](/reduce-javascript-payloads-with-code-splitting).
- [Remove unused code](/remove-unused-code).
- [Minify and compress network payloads](/reduce-network-payloads-using-text-compression).
