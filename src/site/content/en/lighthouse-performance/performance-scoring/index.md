In general, only [metrics audits](/lighthouse-performance/#metrics)
contribute to your Lighthouse Performance score.

For each metrics audit, your page is assigned a score from 0 to 100 based on
real website performance data from the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/).
0 is the lowest possible score and usually indicates an error in Lighthouse.
100 is the highest possible score and indicates
your page is in the ninety-eighth&nbsp;percentile of websites for that metric.

## Why your score fluctuates {: #fluctuations }

A lot of the variability in your overall Performance score and metric scores is not due to Lighthouse.
[Project Lantern](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/lantern.md) has minimized
much of the variance in Lighthouse's measurements.

When your Performance score fluctuates it's usually because of changes in underlying conditions. Common
problems include:

* A/B tests
* Internet traffic routing changes
* Testing with different versions of Lighthouse
* Testing on different devices, such as a high-performance desktop and a low-performance laptop
* Browser extensions that inject JavaScript into all pages you visit and make network requests

Furthermore, even though Lighthouse can provide you a single overall Performance score, it might be more
useful to think of your site performance as a distribution of scores, rather than a single number.
See the introduction of [User-Centric Performance Metrics](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/user-centric-performance-metrics)
to understand why.

## How the performance metrics are weighted {: #weightings }

Each audit is weighted based on heuristics.
More heavily weighted audits have a bigger effect on your overall Performance score.
The tables below show the weighting for each metric in each version of Lighthouse.

{% Aside %}
  The weightings have changed over time because the Lighthouse team is regularly
  doing research and gathering feedback to understand which metrics have the biggest
  impact on user-perceived performance.
