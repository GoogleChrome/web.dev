of your keyboard access needs. That means less time fiddling with `tabindex`,
and more happy users!

## Keyboard support for free (and better mobile experiences)

There are a number of built-in interactive elements with proper semantics and
keyboard support. The ones most developers use are:

- [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)
- [`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
- [`<input>` (and its many
    types)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#Form_%3Cinput%3E_types)
- [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select)
- [`<textarea>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea)

In addition, elements with the
[`contenteditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable)
attribute are sometimes used for freeform text entry.

It's easy to overlook the built-in keyboard support that these elements offer.
Below are some example elements to explore. Instead of using your
mouse, try using your keyboard to operate them. You can use `TAB` (or `SHIFT +
TAB`) to move between controls, and you can use the arrow keys and keys like
`ENTER` and `SPACE` to manipulate their values.

  id: 'interactive-elements',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 450
} %}

If you have a phone handy, you can see that many times these built-in elements
have unique interactions on mobile. Attempting to reproduce these mobile
interactions yourself is a lot of work! It's another good reason to stick to
built-in elements whenever possible.

## Use `button` instead of `div`

A common accessibility anti-pattern is to treat a non-interactive element, like
a `div` or a `span`, as a button by adding a click handler to it.

But to be considered accessible, a button should:

- Be focusable via the keyboard
- Support being disabled
- Support the `ENTER` or `SPACE` keys to perform an action
- Be announced properly by a screen reader

A `div` button has none of these things. That means you'll need to write
additional code to replicate what the `button` element gives you for free!

For example, `button` elements have a neat trick called ****synthetic click
activation****. If you add a "click" handler to a `button`, it will run when the
user presses `ENTER` or `SPACE`. A `div` button doesn't have this feature, so
you'll need to write additional code to listen for the `keydown` event, check
that the keycode is `ENTER` or `SPACE`, and then run your click handler. Ouch!
That's a lot of extra work!

Compare the difference in this example. `TAB` to either control, and use `ENTER`
and `SPACE` to attempt to click on them.

{% Glitch {
  id: 'synthetic-click',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 346
} %}

If you have `div` buttons in your existing site or application, consider
swapping them out for `button` elements. `button` is easy to style and full of
accessibility wins!

## Links versus buttons

Another common anti-pattern is to treat links as buttons by attaching JavaScript
behavior to them.

```html
<a href="#" onclick="// perform some action">
```

Both buttons and links support some form of synthetic click activation. So which
should you choose?

- If clicking on the element will perform an _action_ on the page, use
  `<button>`.
- If clicking on the element will _navigate_ the user to a new page then use
  `<a>`. This includes single page web apps that load new content and update
  the URL using the
  [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History).

The reason for this is that buttons and links are announced differently by
screen readers. Using the correct element helps screen reader users know which
outcome to expect.

## Styling

Some built-in elements, in particular `<input>`, can be difficult to style.
With a bit of clever CSS you may be able to work around some of these
limitations. The (hilariously named) [WTFForms](http://wtfforms.com/) project
contains an [example
stylesheet](https://github.com/mdo/wtf-forms/blob/master/wtf-forms.css)
that demonstrates a number of techniques for styling some of the tougher
built-in elements.

## Next steps

Using built-in HTML elements can greatly improve the accessibility of your site,
and significantly cut down on your workload. Try tabbing through your site and
look for any controls which lack keyboard support. If possible, switch them out
for standardized HTML alternatives.

Sometimes you may find an element that doesn't have a counterpart in HTML.
That's okay! Read on to learn how to add keyboard support to custom interactive
controls using `tabindex`.
