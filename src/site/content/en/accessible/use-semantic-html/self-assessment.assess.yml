    stem: Should this sample use a button or a link?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          This sample should use a **link**. The sample is **correct**.

          When selected, the element navigates
          the user to another page on a different domain,
          so a link is semantic.

    stem: Should this sample use a button or a link?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          This sample should use a **link**. The sample is **correct**.

          When selected, the element navigates
          the user to a different page on the same domain.
          No matter where a resource is located,
          use a link to semantically indicate navigation.
  - stimulus: |
      When selected, this element opens a modal dialog:

      ```html
      <a href="#" onclick="openDialog()">
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Should this sample use a button or a link?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          This sample should use a **button**. The sample is **incorrect**.

          When selected,
          the element runs a function that opens a modal dialog on the same page;
          since the element isn't navigating the user to a separate page,
          a button is semantic.
  - stimulus: |
      When selected, this element opens a navigation menu:

      ```html
      <a href="#" onclick="openNavMenu()">
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Should this sample use a button or a link?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          This sample should use a **button**. The sample is **incorrect**.

          When selected,
          the element runs a function that opens a navigation menu on the same page.
          Opening the menu is an action, so a button is semantic.
  - stimulus: |
      This code renders a horizontal navigation menu at the top of a website:

      ```html
      <nav>
        <button>About</button>
        <button>Services</button>
        <button>Work</button>
        <button>Contact</button>
      </nav>
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Should this sample use buttons or links?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          This sample should use **links**. The sample is **incorrect**.

          The elements in the `<nav>` menu navigate the user to other pages.
          Those pages may be separate resources in a static site,
          or they may be views in a
          [single-page application](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell).
          Either way, since the user is navigating somewhere else,
          links are semantic.
