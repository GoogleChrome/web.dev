  Check whether sample HTML elements have accessible names

questions:
  - stimulus: "![temp](image/user/temp.svg)"
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Does this image have an accessible name?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          **Yes**. Give an image an accessible name by adding an `alt` attribute.
  - stimulus: |
      ```html
      <object type="application/pdf" data="/report.pdf" alt="Annual report"></object>
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Does this object have an accessible name?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          **No**. Give an `<object>` element a name by providing text content.
          (An `alt` attribute on an object will not be read by assistive technologies.)
  - stimulus: |
      This sample renders an icon button:

      ```html
      <button>
        <svg class="icon">
          <use xlink:href="#icon-1" />
        </svg>
      </button>
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Does this button have an accessible name?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          **No**. Give a button an accessible name by providing text content,
          an `aria-label` attribute, or an `aria-labelledby` attribute.
  - stimulus: |
      This sample renders an icon button with a tooltip that appears on hover and focus:

      ```html
      <button>
        <svg class="icon">
          <use xlink:href="#icon-1" />
        </svg>
        <span class="tooltip hidden">Open menu</span>
      </button>
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Does this button have an accessible name?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          **Yes**. Even if the button's tooltip is visually hidden using CSS,
          assistive technologies can still read its text content.

          **Caution:** When visually hiding button text,
          use CSS rather than the `hidden` attribute.
          The `hidden` attribute removes the element
          from the accessibility tree.
  - stimulus: |
      ```html
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" value="subscribe"></input>
        Subscribe to the newsletter?
      </label>
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Does this checkbox have an accessible name?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          **Yes**. The label is associated with the checkbox
          because the label is the checkbox's parent.
          So, assistive technologies treat the label's
          text content as the input's name.
  - stimulus: |
      ```html
      <input type="checkbox" value="subscribe"></input>
      <label for="subscribe">Subscribe to the newsletter?</label>
      ```
    type: think-and-check
    stem: Does this checkbox have an accessible name?
    options:
      - rationale: |
          **No**. The checkbox's `value` attribute indicates
          what text will be saved when the form is submitted,
          but assistive technologies don't read it.
          To provide an accessible name,
          add an `id` attribute with the value `subscribe`
          to associate the checkbox with the label.
