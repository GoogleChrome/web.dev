In order for a screen reader to present a spoken UI to the user, meaningful
elements must have proper labels or text alternatives. A label or text
alternative gives an element its accessible **name**, one of the key properties
for [expressing element semantics in the accessibility tree](/semantics-and-screen-readers/#semantic-properties-and-the-accessibility-tree).

When an element's name is combined with the element's **role**, it gives the
user context so they can understand what type of element they're interacting
with and how it is represented on the page. If a name is not present, then a
screen reader only announces the element's role. Imagine trying to navigate
a page and hearing, "button," "checkbox," "image" without any additional
context. This is why labeling and text alternatives are crucial to a good,
accessible experience.

## Inspect an element's name

It's easy to check an element's accessible name using Chrome's DevTools:

1. Right-click on an element and choose **Inspect**. This opens the DevTools
   Elements panel.
1. In the Elements panel, look for the **Accessibility** pane. It may be hidden
   behind a `»` symbol.
1. In the **Computed Properties** dropdown, look for the **Name** property.

Whether you're looking at an `img` with `alt` text or an `input` with a
`label`, all of these scenarios result in the same outcome: giving an
element its accessible name.

## Check for missing names

There are different ways to add an accessible name to an element,
depending on its type. The following table lists the most common element types
that need accessible names and links to explanations for how to add them.

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Element type</th>

          <a href="#label-form-elements">Label form elements</a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Label documents and frames

Every page should have a
[`title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)
element that briefly explains what the page is about. The `title` element gives
the page its accessible name. When a screen reader enters the page, this is the
first text that is announced.

For example, the page below has the title "Mary's Maple Bar Fast-Baking Recipe":

```html/3
<!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <title>Mary's Maple Bar Fast-Baking Recipe</title>
    </head>
  <body>
    …
  </body>
</html>
```

{% Aside %}
For tips on writing effective titles, see the [Write descriptive titles
guide](/write-descriptive-text).
{% endAside %}

Similarly, any `frame` or `iframe` elements should have `title` attributes:

```html
<iframe title="An interactive map of San Francisco" src="…"></iframe>
```

While an `iframe`'s contents may contain their own internal `title` element, a
screen reader usually stops at the frame boundary and announces the element's
role—"frame"—and its accessible name, provided by the `title` attribute. This
lets the user decide if they wish to enter the frame or bypass it.

## Include text alternatives for images and objects

An `img` should always be accompanied by an
[`alt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Attributes)
attribute to give the image its accessible name. If the image fails to load, the
`alt` text is used as a placeholder so users have a sense of what the image was
trying to convey.

Writing good `alt` text is a bit of an art, but there are a couple of guidelines
you can follow:

1. Determine if the image provides content that would otherwise be difficult to
attain from reading the surrounding text.
1. If so, convey the content as succinctly as possible.

If the image acts as decoration and does not provide any useful content,
you can give it an empty `alt=""` attribute to remove it from the accessibility
tree.

Alternative Text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).

### Images as links and inputs

An image wrapped in a link should use the  `img`'s `alt` attribute to describe
where the user will navigate to if they click on the link:

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">
  <img alt="Google's wikipedia page" src="google-logo.jpg">
</a>
```

Similarly, if an `<input type="image">` element is used to create an image
button, it should contain `alt` text that describes the action that occurs when
the user clicks on the button:

```html/5
<form>
  <label>
    Username:
    <input type="text">
  </label>
  <input type="image" alt="Sign in" src="./sign-in-button.png">
</form>
```

### Embedded objects

`<object>` elements, which are typically used for embeds like Flash, PDFs, or
ActiveX, should also contain alternative text. Similar to images, this text is
displayed if the element fails to render. The alternative text goes inside the
`object` element as regular text, like "Annual report" below:

```html
<object type="application/pdf" data="/report.pdf">
Annual report.
</object>
```

## Label buttons and links

Buttons and links are often crucial to the experience of a site, and it is
important that both have good accessible names.

### Buttons

A `button` element always attempts to compute its accessible name using its
text content. For buttons that are not part of a `form`, writing a clear
action as the text content may be all you need to create a good accessible
name.

```html
<button>Book Room</button>
```

![A mobile form with a 'Book Room' button.](./button-label.png)

One common exception to this rule is icon buttons. An icon button may use an
image or an icon font to provide the text content for the button. For example,
the buttons used in a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor to format
text are typically just graphic symbols:

![A left align icon button.](./icon-button.png)

When working with icon buttons, it can be helpful to give them an explicit
accessible name using the `aria-label` attribute. `aria-label` overrides any
text content inside the button, letting you clearly describe the action to
anyone using a screen reader.

```html
<button aria-label="Left align"></button>
```

### Links

Similar to buttons, links primarily get their accessible name from their text
content. A nice trick when creating a link is to put the most meaningful piece
of text into the link itself, rather than filler words like "Here" or "Read
More."

{% Compare 'worse', 'Not descriptive enough' %}
```html
Check out our guide to web performance <a href="/guide">here</a>.
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Useful content!' %}
```html
Check out <a href="/guide">our guide to web performance</a>.
```
{% endCompare %}

This is especially helpful for screen readers that offer shortcuts to list all
of the links on the page. If links are full of repetitive filler text, these
shortcuts become much less useful:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./vo.jpg" alt="VoiceOver's links menu filled with the word 'here'.">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Example of VoiceOver, a screen reader for macOS, showing the navigate by
    links menu.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Label form elements

There are two ways to associate a label with a form element such as a checkbox.
Either of the methods causes the label text to also become a click target for
the checkbox, which is also helpful for mouse or touchscreen users. To associate
a label with an element, either:

- Place the input element inside of a label element

```html
<label>
  <input type="checkbox">Receive promotional offers?</input>
</label>
```

- Or use the label's `for` attribute and refer to the element's `id`

```html
<input id="promo" type="checkbox"></input>
<label for="promo">Receive promotional offers?</label>
```

When the checkbox has been labeled correctly, the screen reader can report that
the element has a role of checkbox, is in a checked state, and is named "Receive
promotional offers?" like in the VoiceOver example below:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./promo-offers.png"
  alt="VoiceOver text output showing 'Receive promotional offers?'">
</figure>
