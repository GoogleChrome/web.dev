The focus indicator (often signified by a "focus ring") identifies the currently
focused element on your page. For users who are unable to use a mouse, this 
indicator is _extremely important_ because it acts as a stand-in for their 
mouse-pointer.

If the browser's default focus indicator clashes with your design, you can use
CSS to restyle it. Just remember to keep your keyboard users in mind!

## Use `:focus` to always show a focus indicator

The [`:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus)
pseudo-class is applied any time an element is focused, regardless of the input
device (mouse, keyboard, stylus, etc.) or method used to focus it. For example, 
the `<div>` below has a `tabindex` which makes it focusable. It also has a
custom style for its `:focus` state:

```css
div[tabindex="0"]:focus {  
  outline: 4px dashed orange;  
}  
```

Regardless of whether you use a mouse to click on it or a keyboard to tab to it,
the `<div>` will _always_ look the same.

{% Glitch {
  id: 'focus-style',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 346
} %}

Unfortunately browsers can be inconsistent with how they apply focus. Whether or
not an element receives focus may depend on the browser and the operating
system.

For example, the `<button>` below also has a custom style for its `:focus`
state.

```css
button:focus {  
  outline: 4px dashed orange;  
}  
```

If you click on the `<button>` with a mouse in Chrome on macOS you should see
its custom focus style. However, you will not see the custom focus style if you
click on the `<button>` in Firefox or Safari on macOS. This is because in
Firefox and Safari the element does not receive focus when you click on it.

  id: 'focus-style2',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 346
} %}

{% Aside %}
See the
[MDN reference for `<button>` focus behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#Clicking_and_focus)
for a summary of which browsers and operating systems will apply focus to
`<button>` elements.
{% endAside %}

Because the behavior of focus is inconsistent, it may require a bit of testing
on different devices to ensure your focus styles are acceptable to your users.

## Use `:focus-visible` to selectively show a focus indicator

The new
[`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible)
pseudo-class is applied any time that an element receives focus and the 
browser determines via heuristics that displaying a focus indicator would be 
beneficial to the user. In particular, if the most recent user interaction 
was via the keyboard and the key press did not include a meta, `ALT` / `OPTION`,
or `CONTROL` key, then `:focus-visible` will match.

{% Aside %}
`:focus-visible` is currently only supported in Chrome behind a flag,
but there is a [lightweight polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible)
that can be added to your app to make it work.
{% endAside %}

The button in the example below will _selectively_ show a focus indicator. If 
you use a mouse to click on it, the results are different than if you first use 
a keyboard to tab to it.

```css
button:focus-visible {  
  outline: 4px dashed orange;  
}  
```

{% Glitch {
  id: 'focus-visible-style',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 346
} %}

## Use `:focus-within` to style the parent of a focused element

The
[`:focus-within`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within)
pseudo-class is applied to an element either when the element itself receives
focus or when another element inside that element receives focus.

It can be used to highlight a region of the page to draw the
user's attention to that area. For example, the form below receives focus both 
when the form itself is selected and also when any of its radio buttons are 
selected.

```css
form:focus-within {
  background: #ffecb3;
}
```

{% Glitch {
  id: 'focus-within-style',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 346
} %}

## When to display a focus indicator

A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, "If you clicked on this control while
using a mobile device, would you expect it to display a keyboard?"

If the answer is "yes," then the control should probably _always_ show a focus
indicator, regardless of the input device used to focus it. A good example is
the `<input type="text">` element. The user will need to send input to the 
element via the keyboard regardless of how the input element originally received
focus, so it's helpful to always display a focus indicator.

If the answer is "no," then the control may choose to selectively show a focus
indicator. A good example is the `<button>` element. If a user clicks on it with
a mouse or touch screen, the action is complete, and a focus indicator may not
be necessary. However, if the user is _navigating_ with a keyboard, it's useful
to show a focus indicator so the user can decide whether or not they want to 
click the control using the `ENTER` or `SPACE` keys.

## Avoid `outline: none`

The way browsers decide when to draw a focus indicator is, frankly, very
confusing. Changing the appearance of a `<button>` element with CSS or giving
an element a `tabindex` will cause the browser's default focus ring behavior to
kick-in.

A very common anti-pattern is to remove the focus indicator using CSS such as:  

```css
/* Don't do this!!! */  
:focus {  
  outline: none;  
}  
```

A better way to work around this issue is to use a combination of `:focus` and
the `:focus-visible` polyfill. The first block of code below demonstrates how
the polyfill works, and the sample app beneath it provides an example of using
the polyfill to change the focus indicator on a button.

```css
/*  
  This will hide the focus indicator if the element receives focus via the
  mouse, but it will still show up on keyboard focus.  
*/  
.js-focus-visible :focus:not(.focus-visible) {  
  outline: none;  
}

/*  
  Optionally: Define a strong focus indicator for keyboard focus.  
  If you choose to skip this step, then the browser's default focus  
  indicator will be displayed instead.  
*/  
.js-focus-visible .focus-visible {  
  â€¦  
}  
```

  id: 'focus-visible',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 346
} %}
