The `outputLatency` property of an `AudioContext` instance provides an estimate of audio hardware's output latency (for example, that of Bluetooth earbuds or of an external USB audio interface). This property is useful when you want to:

- Synchronize the existing audio material and the newly recorded material. (in a music production scenario)
- Synchronize the [Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) output and other media (e.g. video or MIDI playback).

In this [WebCodecs demo](https://wc-talk.netlify.app/simple_video_player.html) ([source](https://github.com/chcunningham/wc-talk)), the [WebCodecs API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) is used to decode a `MediaStream` into raw video and audio data, and then played back into a HTML `<canvas>` element with audio data coming from an [Audio Worklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet). The `outputLatency` property allows the demo to determine when a given audio timestamp is reaching the user's ears and then properly paint video frames to match that.

Try it out for yourself, play the video with your favorite Bluetooth headset (üéß), wait for the bird (üê¶) (see above), and toggle the checkbox (‚òëÔ∏è) to observe audio playback changes. The total output latency value is updated in real time.
