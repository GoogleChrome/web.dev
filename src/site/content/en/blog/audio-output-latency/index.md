The `outputLatency` property of an `AudioContext` instance provides an estimate of audio hardware's output latency (for example, that of Bluetooth earbuds or of an external USB audio interface). This property is necessary to coordinate/compensate the latency from the input to the output. And it is also very useful when you need to synchronize a video stream and an audio stream produced by the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). The process of synchronizing video and audio streams together is called [AV synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-to-video_synchronization).

In [Chris Cunningham's demo](https://github.com/chcunningham/wc-talk#simple_video_playerhtml-live-demo), the [WebCodecs API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) is used to decode a `MediaStream` into raw video and audio data, and then played back into a HTML `<canvas>` element with audio data coming from the Web Audio API. The `outputLatency` property allows the demo to determine when a given audio timestamp is reaching the user's ears and then properly paint video frames to match that.

Try it out for yourself, play the video with your favorite Bluetooth headset (üéß), wait for the bird (üê¶) (see above), and toggle the checkbox (‚òëÔ∏è) to observe audio playback changes. The total output latency value is updated in real time.
