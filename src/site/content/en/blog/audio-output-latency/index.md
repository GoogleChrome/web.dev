The `outputLatency` property of an `AudioContext` instance provides an estimate of audio hardware‚Äôs output latency (e.g. Bluetooth earbuds or USB external audio interface). This property is necessary to coordinate/compensate the latency from the input to the output. And it is also very useful when you need to synchronize a video stream and an audio stream produced by the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). The process of synchronizing video and audio streams together is called [AV-sync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-to-video_synchronization).

In [Chris Cunningham's demo](https://github.com/chcunningham/wc-talk/blob/main/simple_video_player.html), [WebCodecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) is used to decode a `MediaStream` into raw video and audio data, and then played back into a HTML canvas element with audio data coming from the Web Audio API. The `outputLatency` property allows the demo to determine when a given audio timestamp is reaching the user's ears and then properly paint video frames to match that.

Try it out for yourself, play the video with your favorite Bluetooth headset üéß, wait for the bird üê¶ (see above), and toggle the checkbox ‚òëÔ∏è to observe audio playback changes. The total output latency value is updated in real-time.
