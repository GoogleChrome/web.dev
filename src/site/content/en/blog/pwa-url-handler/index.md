{% Aside %} PWAs as URL Handlers is part of the [capabilities project](https://web.dev/fugu-status/)
and is currently in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses.
{% endAside %}

## What is PWAs as URL Handlers? {: #what }

Imagine you chat with a friend using an instant messenger application like Messages on macOS and you
talk about music. Further imagine you both have the `music.example.com` PWA installed on your
devices. If you want to share your favorite track for your friend to enjoy, you can send them a deep
link like `https://music.example.com/rick-astley/never-gonna-give-you-up`. Since this link is not
particularly user friendly, the developers of `music.example.com` may have decided to add an
additional short link to each track, like, for example, `https://ðŸŽµ.example.com/r-a/n-g-g-y-u`.

PWA as URL Handlers is a proposal that allows apps like `music.example.com` to register themselves
as URL handlers for URLs that match patterns like `music.example.com`, `*.music.example.com`, or
`ðŸŽµ.example.com`, so that links from outside of the PWA, for example, from an instant messenger
application, open in the installed PWA rather than in a browser tab.

This proposal consists of two additions:

1. The `"url_handlers"` Web App Manifest member.
1. The `web-app-origin-association` file format for validating out-of-scope URL associations.

### Suggested use cases for PWAs as URL Handlers {: #use-cases }

Examples of sites that may use this API include:

- Music or video streaming sites.
- News or RSS readers.

## How to use PWAs as URL Handlers {: #use }

### Enabling via about://flags

To experiment with PWAs as URL Handlers locally, without an origin trial token, enable the
`#enable-desktop-pwas-url-handling` flag in `about://flags`.

{% Aside %} Support for the PWAs as URL Handlers feature is limited to desktop operating systems
like Window, macOS, and Linux. {% endAside %}

### The `"url_handlers"` Web App Manifest member

To associate an installed PWA with URL patterns, these patterns need to be specified in the Web App
Manifest. This happens through the `"url_handlers"` member. It accepts an array of objects with the
following property:

- `origin`: A required `string`, which is a pattern for matching origins. These patterns are allowed
  to have a wildcard (`*`) prefix in order to include multiple sub-domains (`*.example.com`). URLs
  that match these origins could be handled by this web app.

The excerpt of a Web App Manifest below shows how the music PWA example from the introductory
paragraph could set this up. The second entry with the wildcard (`"*.music.example.com"`) makes sure
that the app also gets activated for `www.music.example.com` or other examples like
`marketing-activity.music.example.com`.

```json
{
  "url_handlers": [
    {
      "origin": "music.example.com"
    },
    {
      "origin": "*.music.example.com"
    },
    {
      "origin": "ðŸŽµ.example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

{%Aside %} While in an online scenario short links from `ðŸŽµ.example.com` could be redirected to
`music.example.com`, such navigation redirection is not a good alternative with respect to offline
scenarios. Therefore the app needs to register for both origins. {% endAside %}

### The `web-app-origin-association` file

Since the PWA lives on a different domain (`music.example.com`) than some of the URLs it needs to
handle (e.g., `ðŸŽµ.example.com`), the app needs to verify ownership of these other origins. This
happens in a `web-app-origin-association` file hosted on said other origins.

#### Structure of `web-app-origin-association` files

This file must contain valid JSON. The top-level structure is an object, with a member named
`"web_apps"`. This member is an array of objects and each object represents an entry for a unique
web app. Each object contains:

| Field        | Required | Description                                              | Type     | Default |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `"manifest"` | yes      | URL string of the Web App Manifest of the associated PWA | `string` | N/A     |
| `"details"`  | no       | Contains arrays of URL patterns object                   | N/A      |

Each `"details"` object contains:

| Field             | Required | Description                      | Type       | Default |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `"paths"`         | no       | Array of allowed path strings    | `string[]` | `[]`    |
| `"exclude_paths"` | no       | Array of disallowed path strings | `string[]` | `[]`    |

An example `web-app-origin-association` file for the music PWA example from above is given below. It
would be hosted from the origin `ðŸŽµ.example.com` and establishes the association with
`music.example.com`.

```json
{
  "web_apps": [
    {
      "manifest": "https://music.example.com/manifest.webappmanifest",
      "details": {
        "paths": ["/*"],
        "exclude_paths": ["/internal/*"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Regarding `web-app-origin-association` file discovery

For the browser to discover the `web-app-origin-association` file, developers have two choices.

- Add a `<link rel="web-app-origin-association">` element in the header section of the main document
  at the origin's root path that points at the `web-app-origin-association` file via the `href`
  attribute.
- Alternatively, the `web-app-origin-association` file can also be placed in the
  [`/.well-known/`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615) folder at the root level of the
  app. For this to work, the file name must exactly be `web-app-origin-association`.

## Demo

To test PWAs as URL Handlers, be sure to [set the browser flag](#enabling-via-about:flags) as
outlined above and then install the PWA at
[https://mandymsft.github.io/pwa/](https://mandymsft.github.io/pwa/). By looking at its
[Web App Manifest](https://github.com/mandymsft/pwa/blob/main/manifest.json), you can see that it
handles URLs from the following URL patterns: `https://mandymsft.github.io` and
`https://luhuangmsft.github.io`. Since the latter is on a different origin (`luhuangmsft.github.io`)
that the PWA, the PWA on `mandymsft.github.io` needs to prove ownership, which happens via the
`web-app-origin-association` file hosted at
[https://luhuangmsft.github.io/.well-known/web-app-origin-association](https://luhuangmsft.github.io/.well-known/web-app-origin-association).
To test that it is indeed working, send yourself a test message using an instant
messaging app of your choice or an email that you view in an email client that is not web-based like Mail on macOS on
your device with either of the links `https://mandymsft.github.io` or
`https://luhuangmsft.github.io`. Both should open in the installed PWA.
