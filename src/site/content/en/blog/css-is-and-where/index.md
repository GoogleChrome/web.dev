When writing CSS, you can sometimes end up with long selector lists to target
multiple elements with the same style rules. For example, if you want to color
adjust any `<b>` tags found inside a heading element, you could write:

```css
h1 > b, h2 > b, h3 > b, h4 > b, h5 > b, h6 > b {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

Instead, you could use `:is()` and improve legibility while avoiding a long
selector:

```css
:is(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6) > b {
  color: hotpink;
}
```

Legibility and shorter selector conveniences are only a piece of the value that
`:is()` and `:where()` bring to CSS. In this post, you'll discover the syntax
and value of these two functional pseudo selectors.

### Browser compatibility

The `:is` and `:where` pseudo-classes are supported in Chromium (>=88), Firefox
(>= 78) and Safari (>=14). See MDN's [browser
compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:where#Browser_compatibility)
table for more information. Some older browser versions support the `:is()`
selector as `:matches()` or `-webkit-any()`. For more information see the
[`:is()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:is) page on MDN.

## Meet `:is()` and `:where()`

These are functional pseudo-class selectors, notice the `()` at the end and the
way they start with `:`. Think of these as runtime dynamic function calls that
match elements. When writing CSS, they give you a way to group elements together
in the middle, beginning or end of a selector. They also can change specificity,
giving you power to nullify or increase specificity. 

### Selector grouping 

Anything that `:is()` can do regarding grouping, so can `:where()`. This
includes being used anywhere in the selector, nesting, and stacking them. Full
CSS flexibility you know and love. Here's a few examples:

```css
/* at the beginning */
:where(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6) > b {
  color: hotpink;
}

/* in the middle */
article :is(header,footer) > p {
  color: gray;
}

/* at the end */
.dark-theme :where(button,a) {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

/* multiple */
:is(.dark-theme, .dim-theme) :where(button,a) {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

/* stacked */
:is(h1,h2):where(.hero,.subtitle) {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

/* nested */
.hero:is(h1,h2,:is(.header,.boldest)) {
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Each of the above selector examples demonstrates the flexibility of these two
functional pseudo-classes. To find areas of your code that could benefit from
`:is()` or `:where()`, look for selectors with multiple commas and selector
repetition.

### Using simple and complex selectors with `:is()`

For a brush up on selectors, check out the [selectors module on Learn
CSS](/learn/css/selectors/#complex-selectors). Here's a few
examples of simple and complex selectors to help illustrate the ability:

```css
article > :is(p,blockquote) {
  color: black;
}

:is(.dark-theme.hero > h1) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

article:is(.dark-theme:not(main .hero)) {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} 
Normally, when using a `,` to create a list of selectors,
if any of the selectors are invalid, all of the selectors are invalidated and
the list will fail to match elements. That is to say they are not forgiving of
errors. `:is()` and `:where()` though [are
forgiving](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:is#forgiving_selector_parsing),
and can [get you out of a
bind](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/i/is/#forgiving-selector-lists)!
{% endAside %}

So far, `:is()` and `:where()` are syntactically interchangeable. It's time to
look at how they're different.

### The difference between `:is()` and `:where()`

When it comes to specificity, `:is()` and `:where()` strongly diverge. For a
brush up on specificity, see the [specificity module on Learn
CSS](/learn/css/specificity/).

In short
- `:where()` has no specificity.<br>`:where()` squashes all the specificity in
  the selector list passed as functional parameters. This is a first of its
  kind selector feature. 
- `:is()` takes the specificity of its most specific
  selector.<br>`:is(a,div,#id)` has a specificity score of an ID, 100 points.

Taking on the highest specificity selector from the list has only been a gotcha
for me when I was getting too excited about grouping. I was always able to
improve legibility by moving the high specificity selector to it's own selector
where it wouldn't have so much impact. Here's an example of what I mean:

```css
article > :is(header, #nav) {
  background: white;
}

/* better as */
article > header,
article > #nav {
  background: white;
}
```

With `:where()`, I'm waiting to see libraries offer versions with no
specificity. The specificity competition between author styles and library
styles could come to an end. There would be no specificity to compete with when writing CSS. 
CSS has been working on a grouping feature like this for quite some
time, it's here, and it's still largely unexplored territory. Have fun making
smaller stylesheets and removing commas.
