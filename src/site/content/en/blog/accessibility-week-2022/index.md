This week we highlighted accessibility resources to help you make your sites
and applications usable by everyone.

We're continuing to roll out [Learn Accessibility](/learn/accessibility/), a
brand new course written by [Carie Fisher](https://twitter.com/cariefisher)
that will take you through the essentials for building accessible websites and
web apps.

We've had 3 community spotlights:

* [Melanie Sumner](/community-highlight-melanie/) told us about her journey
  into engineering, accessible design, Ember.js, and the importance of funding
  these efforts.
* [Olutimilehin Olushuyi](/community-highlight-shuyi/) told us about his move
  from the law to web development, building accessible community, and creating
  accessible layouts.
* [Albert Kim](/community-highlight-albert-kim/) told us about mental health
  awareness, building for invisible disabilities, the  COGA Accessibility
  Community Group, and more practical wisdom.

## Watch us answer your questions

On Thursday, Alexandra White spoke with Carie Fisher and Melanie Sumner about
