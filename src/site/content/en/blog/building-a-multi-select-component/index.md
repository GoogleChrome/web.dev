In this post I want to share thinking on a way to build a multi-select component. Try the
[demo](https://gui-challenges.web.app/multi-select/dist/).

## Overview

Users are often presented with items, sometimes **lots** of items, and in these
cases it can be a good idea to provide a way to reduce the list to prevent
[choice overload](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/simplicity-vs-choice/). This
blog post explores filtering UI as a way to reduce choices. It does this by
presenting item attributes that users can select or deselect, reducing results
and therefore reducing choice overload.

### Interactions

The goal is to enable swift traversal of filter options for all users and their
varying input types. This will be delivered with an adaptable and responsive
pair of components. A traditional sidebar of checkboxes for desktop, keyboard
and screen readers, and a [`<select
multiple>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/multiple)
for touch users.

{% Img src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/784yEixWzAhzh8GqUhLM.png",
alt="Comparison screenshot showing desktop light and dark with a sidebar of
checkboxes vs mobile iOS and Android with a multi-select element.", width="800",
height="434" %}

This decision to use built-in multiselect for touch, and not for desktop, saves work and creates work, but I believe delivers appropriate experiences with less code debt than building the entire responsive experience in one component.

#### Touch

The touch component saves on space and helps user interaction accuracy on
mobile. It saves space by collapsing an entire sidebar of checkboxes into a
`<select>` built-in overlay touch experience. It helps input accuracy by showing
a large touch overlay experience provided by the system.

{% Img src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/hox09QWcjlL9wemzO1EI.png", alt="A
screenshot preview of the multi-select element in Chrome on Android, iPhone and
iPad. The iPad and iPhone have the multi-select toggled open, and each get a
unique experience optimized for the screen size.", width="800", height="483" %}

#### Keyboard and gamepad

Below is a demonstration of how to use a `<select multiple>` from the keyboard.

{% Video
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/Ahh0DJ7upPdNox1hFjM0.mp4",
  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true",
  width="640"
%}

This built-in multi-select can't be styled and is only offered in a compact
layout not suitable for presenting a lot of options. See how you can't really
see the breadth of options in that tiny box? While you can change its size, it's
still not as usable as a sidebar of checkboxes.

{% Video
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/7FXTAv3VQ2xzJnLZDZWk.mp4",
  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true"
%}

## Markup

Both components will be contained in the same `<form>` element. The results of
this form, whether checkboxes or a multi-select, will be observed and used to
filter the grid, but could also be submitted to a server.

```html
<form>

</form>
```

### Checkboxes component

Groups of checkboxes should be wrapped in a
[`<fieldset>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset)
element and given a
[`<legend>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend).
When HTML is structured this way, screen readers and
[FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FormData) will
automatically understand the relationship of the elements.

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>New</legend>
    … checkboxes …
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

With the grouping in place, add a `<label>` and `<input type="checkbox">` for
each of the filters. I chose to wrap mine in a `<div>` so the CSS `gap` property
can space them evenly and maintain alignment when labels go multiline.

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>New</legend>
    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id="last 30 days" name="new" value="last 30 days">
      <label for="last 30 days">Last 30 Days</label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id="last 6 months" name="new" value="last 6 months">
      <label for="last 6 months">Last 6 Months</label>
    </div>
   </fieldset>
</form>
```

  fieldset elements, shows color and element name.",
  width="800", height="616"
%}

### `<select multiple>` component

A seldom used feature of the `<select>` element is
[`multiple`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/multiple).
When the attribute is used with a `<select>` element, the user is allowed to
choose many from the list. It's like changing the interaction from a radio list
to a checkbox list.

```html
<form>
  <select multiple="true" title="Filter results by category">
    …
  </select>
</form>
```

To label and create groups inside of a `<select>`, use the
[`<optgroup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup)
element and give it a `label` attribute and value. This element and attribute
value are akin to the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements.

```html
<form>
  <select multiple="true" title="Filter results by category">
    <optgroup label="New">
      …
    </optgroup>
  </select>
</form>
```

Now add the
[`<option>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option)
elements for the filter.

```html
<form>
  <select multiple="true" title="Filter results by category">
    <optgroup label="New">
      <option value="last 30 days">Last 30 Days</option>
      <option value="last 6 months">Last 6 Months</option>
    </optgroup>
  </select>
</form>
```

### Tracking input with counters to inform assistive technology

The [status
role](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_status_role)
technique is used in this user experience, to track and maintain the tally of
filters for screen readers and other assistive technologies. The YouTube video
demonstrates the feature. The integration begins with HTML and the attribute
`role="status"`.

```html
<div role="status" class="sr-only" id="applied-filters"></div>
```

This element will read aloud changes made to the contents. We can update the
contents with [CSS
counters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Lists_and_Counters/Using_CSS_counters)
as users interact with the checkboxes. To do that we first need to create a
counter with a name on a parent element of the inputs and state element.

```css
aside {
  counter-reset: filters;
}
```

By default, the count will be `0`, which is great, nothing is `:checked` by
default in this design.

Next, to increment our newly created counter, we'll target children of the
`<aside>` element that are `:checked`. As the user changes the state of inputs,
the `filters` counter will tally up.

```css
aside :checked {
  counter-increment: filters;
}
```

CSS is now aware of the general tally of the checkbox UI and the status role
element is empty and awaiting values. Since CSS is maintaining the tally in
memory, the
[`counter()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/counter())
function allows accessing the value from [pseudo
element](/learn/css/pseudo-elements/) contents:

```css
aside #applied-filters::before {
  content: counter(filters) " filters ";
}
```

The HTML for the status role element will now announce "2 filters " to a screen
reader. This is a good start, but we can do better, like share the tally of
results the filters have updated. We'll do this work from JavaScript, as it's
outside what counters can do.

  class="w-screenshot",
  alt="A screenshot of the MacOS screen reader announcing number of active filters.",
  width="800", height="177"
%}

#### Nesting excitement

The counters algorithm felt great with [CSS
nesting-1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/), as I was able to put all the
logic into one block. Feels portable and centralized for reading and updating.

```css
aside {
  counter-reset: filters;

  & :checked {
    counter-increment: filters;
  }

  & #applied-filters::before {
    content: counter(filters) " filters ";
  }
}
```

  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true"
%}

{% Aside %}
I pass my nesting syntax through this [PostCSS Nesting
plugin](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-nesting) so it works in browsers
today.

## Layouts

This section describes the layouts between the two components. Most of the
layout styles are for the desktop checkbox component.

### The form

To optimize legibility and scannability for users, the form is given a maximum
width of 30 characters, essentially setting an optical line width for each
filter label. The form uses grid layout and the `gap` property to space out the
fieldsets.

```css
form {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2ch;
  max-inline-size: 30ch;
}
```

### The `<select>` element

The list of labels and checkboxes both consume too much space on mobile.
Therefore, the layout checks to see the user’s primary pointing device to change
the experience for touch.

```css
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  select[multiple] {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

A value of `coarse` indicates that the user will not be able to interact with
the screen with high amounts of precision with their primary input device. On a
mobile device, the pointer value is often `coarse`, as the primary interaction
is touch. On a desktop device, the pointer value is often `fine` as it's common
to have a mouse or other high precision input device connected.

### The fieldsets

The default styling and layout of a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` is unique:

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/YGuj5hH6ZuYW08YD1S1C.png",
  class="w-screenshot",
  alt="A screenshot of the default styles for a fieldset and legend.",
  width="568", height="550"
%}

Normally, to space my child elements I'd use the `gap` property, but the unique
positioning of the `<legend>` makes it difficult to create an evenly spaced set
of children. Instead of `gap`, the [adjacent sibling
selector](/learn/css/selectors/#next-sibling-combinator) and
`margin-block-start` are used.

```css
fieldset {
  padding: 2ch;

  & > div + div {
    margin-block-start: 2ch;
  }
}
```

This skips the `<legend>` from having it's space adjusted by targeting just the
`<div>` children.

  class="w-screenshot",
  alt="Screenshot showing the margin spacing between inputs but not the legend.",
  width="768", height="602"
%}

### The filter label and checkbox

As a direct child of a `<fieldset>` and within the max width of the form's
`30ch`, label text may wrap if too long. Wrapping text is great, but
misalignment between text and checkbox is not. Flexbox is ideal for this.

```css
fieldset > div {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2ch;
  align-items: baseline;
}
```

### The animated grid

The layout animation is done by [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/). A
performant and powerful plugin for interactive sort and filter.

## JavaScript

In addition to helping orchestrate a neat animated, interactive grid, JavaScript
is used to polish a couple of rough edges.

### Normalizing the user input

This design has one form with two different ways to provide input, and they
don't
[serialize](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization) the
same. With some JavaScript though, we can
[normalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) the data.

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/uBPBUzFc45v13Effbz8P.png",
  class="w-screenshot",
  alt="Screenshot of the DevTools JavaScript console which
  shows the goal, normalized data results.",
  width="800", height="355"
%}

I chose to align the `<select>` element data structure to the grouped checkboxes
structure. To do this, an
[`input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event)
event listener is added to the `<select>` element, at which point it's
[`selectedOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement/selectedOptions)
are mapped.

```js
document.querySelector('select').addEventListener('input', event => {
  // make selectedOptions iterable then reduce a new array object
  let selectData = Array.from(event.target.selectedOptions).reduce((data, opt) => {
    // parent optgroup label and option value are added to the reduce aggregator
    data.push([opt.parentElement.label.toLowerCase(), opt.value])
    return data
  }, [])
})
```

Now it's safe to submit the form, or in the case of this demo, instruct Isotope
on what to filter by.

### Finishing the status role element

The element is only tallying and announcing filter count based on checkbox
interaction but I felt it was a good idea to additionally share the number of
results and ensure the `<select>` element choices are counted as well.

#### `<select>` element choice reflected in the `counter()`

In the data normalization section, a listener was already created on input. At
the end of this function the number of chosen filters and the number of results
for those filters are known. The values can be passed to the state role element
like this.

```js
let statusRoleElement = document.querySelector('#applied-filters')
statusRoleElement.style.counterSet = selectData.length
```

#### Results reflected in the `role="status"` element

`:checked` provides a built-in way of passing the number of chosen filters to
the status role element, but lacks visibility to the filtered number of results.
JavaScript can watch for interaction with the checkboxes and after filtering the
grid, add `textContent` like the `<select>` element did.

```js
document
  .querySelector('aside form')
  .addEventListener('input', e => {
    // isotope demo code
    let filterResults = IsotopeGrid.getFilteredItemElements().length
    document.querySelector('#applied-filters').textContent = `giving ${filterResults} results`
})
```

Altogether this work completes the announcement "2 filters giving 25 results".

{% Img

  class="w-screenshot",
  alt="A screenshot of the MacOS screen reader announcing results.",
  width="800", height="177"
%}

Now our excellent assistive technology experience will be delivered to all the
users, however they interact with it.
