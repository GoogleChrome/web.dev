In our [introductory blog post](/aurora), we covered how we've learned a lot while
building and using frameworks and tools to develop and maintain large scale web applications such as
Google Search, Maps, Photos, and so on. By safeguarding developers from writing code that can
negatively affect user experience, we proved that frameworks can play a key role in shifting
outcomes for performance and application quality.

Internally at Google, we used the term "**Conformance**" to describe this methodology, and this
article covers how we plan to open-source this concept to the JavaScript framework ecosystem.

## What is Conformance?

At Google, Conformance was an evolution. Teams relied on a small set of deeply experienced
maintainers who did extensive code reviews, flagging things that impacted app quality and
maintainability well beyond correctness issues. To scale this to growing teams of app developers, a
Conformance system was developed to codify best practices in a way that is automated and
enforceable. This ensured a consistently high bar for app quality and codebase maintainability
regardless of the number of code contributors.

Conformance is a system that ensures that developers stay on the well-lit path;
it builds confidence and ensures predictable outcomes. It makes teams
productive, and becomes crucial for _scale_ -- as teams grow and more features
are developed simultaneously. It empowers developers to focus on building
product features, freeing them from minutiae and the changing landscape in
various areas such as performance, accessibility, security, etc. Anyone can
opt-out of Conformance at any time, and it should be customizable to the extent
that teams will have the option to enforce whatever they decide to commit to.

Conformance is founded on **strong defaults** and providing **actionable rules** that can be
enforced at **authoring time**. This breaks down into the following 3 principles.

performance & [Core Web Vital](/vitals/) scores, but the principles apply equally to
other aspects such as security, accessibility, and so forth.

### 1. Strong defaults

A foundational aspect of conformance is ensuring that the tools developers use have strong defaults
in place. This means solutions are not only baked into frameworks, but also framework design
patterns make it easy to do the right thing and hard to follow anti-patterns. The framework supports
developers with application design and code structure.

For loading performance, every resource (fonts, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) should be optimized.
This is a complex challenge involving trimming of bytes, reducing round trips, and separating out
what is needed for the first render, visual readiness, and user interaction. For example, extracting
critical CSS, and setting priority on important images.

### 2. Actionable rules

Even with foundational optimizations in place, developers still have to make choices. There's a
spectrum of possibilities for optimizations when it comes to how much developer input is needed:

- Defaults that require no developer input such as inlining critical CSS.
- Require developer opt-in. For example, using a framework-provided image component to size and
  scale images.
- Require developer opt-in and customization. For example, tagging important images to be loaded
  early.
- Not a specific feature but things that still require developer decision. For example, avoiding
  fonts or synchronous scripts that delay early rendering.

spectrum between automatic and manual developer optimizations", width="800", height="450" %}

Optimizations that require any decision by developers pose a risk to the performance of the
application. As features are added and your team scales, even the most experienced developers cannot
keep up with the constantly changing best practices, nor is it the best use of their time. For
Conformance, appropriate actionable rules are as important as strong defaults to ensure that the
application continues to meet a certain standard even when developers continue to make changes.

### 3. Authoring time

It's important to catch and _preclude_ performance problems early in the development lifecycle.
Authoring time, before code is committed, is ideally suited to catching and addressing problems. The
later a problem is caught in the development lifecycle, the harder and more expensive it is to
address it. While this applies to correctness issues, it is also true for performance issues, as
many of these issues will not be retroactively addressed once committed to the codebase.

Today, most performance feedback is out-of-band via documentation, one-off audits, or it is surfaced
too late via metrics regression after deployment to production. We want to bring this to authoring
time.

## Conformance in Frameworks

To maintain a high bar of user experience for loading performance, the following questions need to
be answered:

1. What constitutes optimal loading, and what are the common issues that could impact it adversely?
2. Which solutions can be baked in that do not need any developer input?
3. How can we ensure that the developer uses these solutions and leverages them optimally?
4. What other choices could the developer make that impact loading performance?
5. What are the code patterns that can tell us about these choices (#3 and #4 above) early at
   authoring time?
6. What rules can we formulate to assess these code patterns? How can they be surfaced to the
   developer at authoring time while seamlessly integrated into their workflow?

To bring the Conformance model we have internally at Google to open-source frameworks, our team has
experimented heavily in Next.js and we are excited to share our refined vision and plans. We've
realized that the best set of rules that can assess code patterns will need to be a combination of
**static code analysis** and **dynamic checks.** These rules can span multiple surfaces, including:

- ESLint
- TypeScript
- Dynamic checks in the user's development server (post DOM creation)
- Module bundler (webpack)
- CSS tooling (still exploratory)

By taking advantage of providing rules through different tools, we can ensure they are cohesive but
also encompass any user experience issues that directly impact loading performance. Additionally,
these rules can also be surfaced to developers at different times:

- During local development in the development server, browser and user's IDE will surface warnings,
  prompting developers to make small code changes.
- At build time, unresolved issues will be resurfaced in the user's terminal

In a nutshell, teams will choose outcomes they care about, such as Core Web Vitals or loading
performance, and enable relevant rulesets for all code contributors to follow.

While this works really well for new projects, it's not easy to upgrade large codebases to comply
with full rulesets. At Google we have an extensive system for opting-out at different levels such as
individual lines of source code, entire directories, legacy codebases or parts of the app that are
not under active development. We are actively exploring effective strategies for bringing this to
teams using open-source frameworks.

## Conformance in Next.js

ESLint is widely used among JavaScript developers. and over 50% of Next.js applications use ESLint
in some part of their build workflow. Next.js v11 introduced out-of-the-box ESLint support that
includes a [custom plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#eslint-plugin) and
[shareable configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#base-configuration) to
make it easier to catch common framework-specific issues during development and at build time. This
can help developers fix significant problems at authoring time. Examples include when a certain
component is used, or not used, in a way that could harm performance as in [No HTML link for
page](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-html-link-for-pages)). Or, if a certain font, stylesheet,
or script can negatively affect resource loading on a page. For example, [No synchronous
script](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-sync-scripts).

In addition to ESLint, [integrated
type-checking](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#built-in-zero-config-typescript-support) in both
development and production has been supported in Next.js since v9 with TypeScript support. Multiple
components provided by the framework (Image, Script, Link) have been built as an extension of HTML
elements (`<img>`, `<script>`, `<a>`) to provide developers with a performant approach to adding
content to a web page. Type-checking supports appropriate usage of these features by ensuring that
properties and options assigned are in the acceptable scope of supported values and types. See
[required Image width and height](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#width) for an
example.

### Surfacing Errors With Toasts and Overlays

As mentioned previously, Conformance rules can be surfaced in multiple areas. Toasts and overlays
are currently being explored as a way to surface errors directly in the browser within the user's
local development environment.

toasts", width="800", height="454" %}

Many error-checking and auditing tools that developers rely on (Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools Issues
tab) are passive and require some form of user interaction to retrieve information. Developers are
more likely to act when errors are surfaced directly within their existing tooling, and when they
provide concrete and specific actions that should be taken to fix the problem.

{% Aside %}
Utilizing toasts and overlays as a UI surface for Conformance is still being explored in
Next.js.
{% endAside %}

### Conformance in Other Frameworks

Conformance is being explored in Next.js first with the goal of expanding to other frameworks
(Nuxt, Angular, etc.). ESLint and TypeScript are already used in many frameworks in many
different ways, but the concept of a cohesive, browser-level runtime system is being actively
explored.

## Conclusion

Conformance codifies best practices into rulesets that are actionable for developers as simple code
patterns. The Aurora team has focused on loading performance, but other best practices, such as
accessibility and security, are just as applicable.

Following Conformance rules should result in predictable outcomes, and achieving a high bar for user
experience can become a side-effect of building on your tech stack. Conformance makes teams
productive, and ensures a high quality bar for the application, even as teams and codebases grow
over time.
