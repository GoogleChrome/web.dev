{% Aside %}
Web apps should be able to do anything iOS/Android/desktop apps can. The [Capabilities
project](/fugu-status/), of which Serial API is only a part, aims to do just
that. To learn about other capabilities and to keep up with their progress,
follow [Unlocking new capabilities for the web](/fugu-status/).
{% endAside %}

## What is the Serial API? {: #what }

A serial port is a bidirectional communication interface that allows sending and
receiving data byte by byte.

The Serial API provides a way for websites to read from and write to a serial
device with JavaScript. Serial devices are connected either through a serial
port on the user's system or through removable USB and Bluetooth devices that
emulate a serial port.

In other words, the Serial API bridges the web and the physical world by
allowing websites to communicate with serial devices, such as microcontrollers
and 3D printers.

This API is also a great companion to [WebUSB] as operating systems require
applications to communicate with some serial ports using their higher-level
serial API rather than the low-level USB API.

{% Aside  %}
This article reflects the Serial API as implemented in Chrome 86 and later. Some
property names have changed from previous versions.
{% endAside %}

## Suggested use cases {: #use-cases }

In the educational, hobbyist, and industrial sectors, users connect peripheral
devices to their computers. These devices are often controlled by
microcontrollers via a serial connection used by custom software. Some custom
software to control these devices is built with web technology:

- [Arduino Create]
- [Betaflight Configurator]
- [Espruino Web IDE]
- [Microsoft MakeCode]

In some cases, websites communicate with the device through an agent
application that users installed manually. In others, the application is
delivered in a packaged application through a framework such as Electron.
And in others, the user is required to perform an additional step such as
copying a compiled application to the device via a USB flash drive.

In all these cases, the user experience will be improved by providing direct
communication between the website and the device that it is controlling.

## Using the Serial API {: #use }

### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with the Serial API locally on all desktop platforms, without an
origin trial token, enable the `#experimental-web-platform-features` flag in
`chrome://flags`.

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

The Serial API is available on all desktop platforms (Chrome OS, Linux, macOS,
and Windows) as an origin trial in Chrome 80. The origin trial is expected to
end just before Chrome 89 moves to stable in February 2021. The API can also
be enabled using a flag.

{% include 'content/origin-trials.njk' %}

### Register for the origin trial {: #ot }

{% include 'content/origin-trial-register.njk' %}

### Feature detection {: #feature-detection }

To check if the Serial API is supported, use:

```js
if ("serial" in navigator) {
  // The Serial API is supported.
}
```

### Open a serial port {: #open-port }

The Serial API is asynchronous by design. This prevents the website UI from
blocking when awaiting input, which is important because serial data can be
received at any time, requiring a way to listen to it.

To open a serial port, first access a `SerialPort` object. For this, you can
either prompt the user to select a single serial port by calling
`navigator.serial.requestPort()`, or pick one from `navigator.serial.getPorts()`
which returns a list of serial ports the website has been granted access to
previously.

```js
// Prompt user to select any serial port.
const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort();
```

```js
// Get all serial ports the user has previously granted the website access to.
const ports = await navigator.serial.getPorts();
```

The `navigator.serial.requestPort()` function takes an optional object literal
that defines filters. Those are used to match any serial device connected over
USB with a mandatory USB vendor (`usbVendorId`) and optional USB product
identifiers (`usbProductId`).

```js
// Filter on devices with the Arduino Uno USB Vendor/Product IDs.
const filters = [
  { usbVendorId: 0x2341, usbProductId: 0x0043 },
  { usbVendorId: 0x2341, usbProductId: 0x0001 }
];

// Prompt user to select an Arduino Uno device.
const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort({ filters });

const { usbProductId, usbVendorId } = port.getInfo();
```

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./serial-port-prompt.jpg" class="w-screenshot" alt="Screenshot of a serial port prompt on a website">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">User prompt for selecting a BBC micro:bit</figcaption>
</figure>

Calling `requestPort()` prompts the user to select a device and returns a
`SerialPort` object. Once you have a `SerialPort` object, calling `port.open()`
with the desired baud rate will open the serial port. The `baudRate` dictionary
member specifies how fast data is sent over a serial line. It is expressed in
units of bits-per-second (bps). Check your device's documentation for the
correct value as all the data you send and receive will be gibberish if this is
specified incorrectly. For some USB and Bluetooth devices that emulate a serial
port this value may be safely set to any value as it is ignored by the
emulation.

```js
// Prompt user to select any serial port.
const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort();

// Wait for the serial port to open.
await port.open({ baudRate: 9600 });
```
 
You can also specify any of the options below when opening a serial port. These
options are optional and have convenient [default values].

- `dataBits`: The number of data bits per frame (either 7 or 8).
- `stopBits`: The number of stop bits at the end of a frame (either 1 or 2).
- `parity`: The parity mode (either `"none"`, `"even"` or `"odd"`).
- `bufferSize`: The size of the read and write buffers that should be created
  (must be less than 16MB).
- `flowControl`: The flow control mode (either `"none"` or `"hardware"`).

### Read from a serial port {: #read-port }

Input and output streams in the Serial API are handled by the Streams API.

{% Aside %}
If streams are new to you, check out [Streams API
concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts).
This article barely scratches the surface of streams and stream handling.
{% endAside %}

After the serial port connection is established, the `readable` and `writable`
properties from the `SerialPort` object return a [ReadableStream] and a
[WritableStream]. Those will be used to receive data from and send data to the
serial device. Both use `Uint8Array` instances for data transfer.

When new data arrives from the serial device, `port.readable.getReader().read()`
returns two properties asynchronously: the `value` and a `done` boolean. If
`done` is true, the serial port has been closed or there is no more data coming
in. Calling `port.readable.getReader()` creates a reader and locks `readable` to
it. While `readable` is [locked], the serial port can't be closed.

```js
const reader = port.readable.getReader();

// Listen to data coming from the serial device.
while (true) {
  const { value, done } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    // Allow the serial port to be closed later.
    reader.releaseLock();
    break;
  }
  // value is a Uint8Array.
  console.log(value);
}
```

Some non-fatal serial port read errors can happen under some conditions such as
buffer overflow, framing errors, or parity errors. Those are thrown as
exceptions and can be caught by adding another loop on top of the previous one
that checks `port.readable`. This works because as long as the errors are
non-fatal, a new [ReadableStream] is created automatically. If a fatal error
occurs, such as the serial device being removed, then `port.readable` becomes
null.

```js/0,3,15-18
while (port.readable) {
  const reader = port.readable.getReader();

  try {
    while (true) {
      const { value, done } = await reader.read();
      if (done) {
        // Allow the serial port to be closed later.
        reader.releaseLock();
        break;
      }
      if (value) {
        console.log(value);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // TODO: Handle non-fatal read error.
  }
}
```

If the serial device sends text back, you can pipe `port.readable` through a
`TextDecoderStream` as shown below. A `TextDecoderStream` is a [transform stream]
that grabs all `Uint8Array` chunks and converts them to strings.

```js/0-2,12
const textDecoder = new TextDecoderStream();
const readableStreamClosed = port.readable.pipeTo(textDecoder.writable);
const reader = textDecoder.readable.getReader();

// Listen to data coming from the serial device.
while (true) {
  const { value, done } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    // Allow the serial port to be closed later.
    reader.releaseLock();
    break;
  }
  // value is a string.
  console.log(value);
}
```

### Write to a serial port {: #write-port }

To send data to a serial device, pass data to
`port.writable.getWriter().write()`. Calling `releaseLock()` on
`port.writable.getWriter()` is required for the serial port to be closed later.

```js
const writer = port.writable.getWriter();

const data = new Uint8Array([104, 101, 108, 108, 111]); // hello
await writer.write(data);


// Allow the serial port to be closed later.
writer.releaseLock();
```

Send text to the device through a `TextEncoderStream` piped to `port.writable`
as shown below.

```js
const textEncoder = new TextEncoderStream();
const writableStreamClosed = textEncoder.readable.pipeTo(port.writable);

const writer = textEncoder.writable.getWriter();

await writer.write("hello");
```

### Close a serial port {: #close-port }

`port.close()` closes the serial port if its `readable` and `writable` members
are [unlocked], meaning `releaseLock()` has been called for their respective
reader and writer.

```js
await port.close();
```

However, when continuously reading data from a serial device using a loop,
`port.readable` will always be locked until it encounters an error. In this
case, calling `reader.cancel()` will force `reader.read()` to resolve
immediately with `{ value: undefined, done: true }` and therefore allowing the
loop to call `reader.releaseLock()`.

```js/15-18
// Without transform streams.

const reader = port.readable.getReader();

// Listen to data coming from the serial device.
while (true) {
  const { value, done } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    reader.releaseLock();
    break;
  }
  // value is a Uint8Array.
  console.log(value);
}

// Force reader.read() to resolve immediately and subsequently
// call reader.releaseLock() in the loop example above.
await reader.cancel();
await port.close();
```

Closing a serial port is more complicated when using [transform streams] (like
`TextDecoderStream` and `TextEncoderStream`). Call `reader.cancel()` as before.
Then call `writer.close()` and `port.close()`.  This propagates errors through
the transform streams to the underlying serial port. Because error propagation
doesn't happen immediately, you need to use the `readableStreamClosed` and
`writableStreamClosed` promises created earlier to detect when `port.readable`
and `port.writable` have been unlocked. Cancelling the `reader` causes the
stream to be aborted; this is why you must catch and ignore the resulting error.

```js/20-26
// With transform streams.

const textDecoder = new TextDecoderStream();
const readableStreamClosed = port.readable.pipeTo(textDecoder.writable);
const reader = textDecoder.readable.getReader();

// Listen to data coming from the serial device.
while (true) {
  const { value, done } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    reader.releaseLock();
    break;
  }
  // value is a string.
  console.log(value);
}

const textEncoder = new TextEncoderStream();
const writableStreamClosed = textEncoder.readable.pipeTo(port.writable);

reader.cancel();
await readableStreamClosed.catch(() => { /* Ignore the error */ });

writer.close();
await writableStreamClosed;

await port.close();
```

### Listen to connection and disconnection {: #connection-disconnection }

If a serial port is provided by a USB device then that device may be connected
or disconnected from the system. When the website has been granted permission to
access a serial port, it should monitor the `connect` and `disconnect` events.

```js
navigator.serial.addEventListener("connect", (event) => {
  // TODO: Automatically open event.port or warn user a port is available.
});

navigator.serial.addEventListener("disconnect", (event) => {
  // TODO: Remove |event.port| from the UI.
  // If the serial port was opened, a stream error would be observed as well.
});
```

### Handle signals {: #signals }

After establishing the serial port connection, you can explicitly query and set
signals exposed by the serial port for device detection and flow control. These
signals are defined as boolean values. For example, some devices such as Arduino
will enter a programming mode if the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal is
toggled.

Setting [output signals] and getting [input signals] are respectively done by
calling `port.setSignals()` and `port.getSignals()`. See usage examples below.

```js
// Turn off Serial Break signal.
await port.setSignals({ break: false });

// Turn on Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.
await port.setSignals({ dataTerminalReady: true });

// Turn off Request To Send (RTS) signal.
await port.setSignals({ requestToSend: false });
```

```js
const signals = await port.getSignals();
console.log(`Clear To Send:       ${signals.clearToSend}`);
console.log(`Data Carrier Detect: ${signals.dataCarrierDetect}`);
console.log(`Data Set Ready:      ${signals.dataSetReady}`);
console.log(`Ring Indicator:      ${signals.ringIndicator}`);
```

### Transforming streams {: #transforming-streams }

When you receive data from the serial device, you won't necessarily get all of
the data at once. It may be arbitrarily chunked. For more information, see
[Streams API concepts].

To deal with this, you can use some built-in transform streams such as
`TextDecoderStream` or create your own transform stream which allows you to
parse the incoming stream and return parsed data. The transform stream sits
between the serial device and the read loop that is consuming the stream. It can
apply an arbitrary transform before the data is consumed. Think of it like an
assembly line: as a widget comes down the line, each step in the line modifies
the widget, so that by the time it gets to its final destination, it's a fully
functioning widget.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./aeroplane-factory.jpg" alt="Photo of an aeroplane factory">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">World War II Castle Bromwich Aeroplane Factory</figcaption>
</figure>

For example, consider how to create a transform stream class that consumes a
stream and chunks it based on line breaks. Its `transform()` method is called
every time new data is received by the stream. It can either enqueue the data or
save it for later. The `flush()` method is called when the stream is closed, and
it handles any data that hasn't been processed yet.

To use the transform stream class, you need to pipe an incoming stream through
it. In the third code example under [Read from a serial port](#read-port),
the original input stream was only piped through a `TextDecoderStream`, so we
need to call `pipeThrough()` to pipe it through our new `LineBreakTransformer`.

```js
class LineBreakTransformer {
  constructor() {
    // A container for holding stream data until a new line.
    this.chunks = "";
  }

  transform(chunk, controller) {
    // Append new chunks to existing chunks.
    this.chunks += chunk;
    // For each line breaks in chunks, send the parsed lines out.
    const lines = this.chunks.split("\r\n");
    this.chunks = lines.pop();
    lines.forEach((line) => controller.enqueue(line));
  }

  flush(controller) {
    // When the stream is closed, flush any remaining chunks out.
    controller.enqueue(this.chunks);
  }
}
```

```js/2-5
const textDecoder = new TextDecoderStream();
const readableStreamClosed = port.readable.pipeTo(textDecoder.writable);
const reader = textDecoder.readable
  .pipeThrough(new TransformStream(new LineBreakTransformer()))
  .getReader();
```

For debugging serial device communication issues, use the `tee()` method of
`port.readable` to split the streams going to or from the serial device. The two
streams created can be consumed independently and this allows you to print one
to the console for inspection.

```js
const [appReadable, devReadable] = port.readable.tee();

// You may want to update UI with incoming data from appReadable
// and log incoming data in JS console for inspection from devReadable.
```

## Dev Tips {: #dev-tips }

Debugging the Serial API in Chrome is easy with the internal page, `chrome://device-log`
where you can see all serial device related events in one single place.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./device-log-page-screenshot.jpg" class="w-screenshot" alt="Screenshot of the internal page for debugging the Serial API.">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Internal page in Chrome for debugging the Serial API.</figcaption>
</figure>

{% Aside %}
The internal page supports debugging the Serial API in Chrome 87 and later.
{% endAside %}

## Codelab {: #codelab }

In the [Google Developer codelab], you'll use the Serial API to interact with a
[BBC micro:bit] board to show images on its 5x5 LED matrix.

## Polyfill {: #polyfill }

On Android, support for USB-based serial ports is possible using the WebUSB API
and the [Serial API polyfill]. This polyfill is limited to hardware and
platforms where the device is accessible via the WebUSB API because it has not
been claimed by a built-in device driver.

## Security and privacy {: #security-privacy }

The spec authors have designed and implemented the Serial API using the core
principles defined in [Controlling Access to Powerful Web Platform Features],
including user control, transparency, and ergonomics. The ability to use this
API is primarily gated by a permission model that grants access to only a single
serial device at a time. In response to a user prompt, the user must take active
steps to select a particular serial device.

To understand the security tradeoffs, check out the [security] and [privacy]
sections of the Serial API Explainer.
