[Tags](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/3281060?hl=en) are snippets
of third-party code that are inserted into a site, typically via a tag manager.
Tags are most commonly used for marketing and analytics.

{% Aside %}

Although tags and third-party scripts are often fundamentally the exact same
thing, the separate terminology reflects the different ways that these scripts
are used: "tags" are typically owned by marketing departments and added via tag
managers; whereas "third-party scripts" more commonly refer to resources added
through code changes made by engineering departments.

{% endAside %}

The performance impact of tags and tag managers varies wildly from site to site.
Tag managers can be compared to an envelope: the tag manager provides a
vessel—but what you fill it with and how you use it is mostly up to you.

This article discusses techniques for optimizing tags and tag managers for
performance and Web Vitals. Although this article references Google Tag Manager,
many of the ideas discussed are also applicable to other tag managers.


## Tag types

The impact of tags on performance varies by tag type. Generally speaking, image
tags ("pixels") are the most performant, followed by custom templates, and
lastly, custom HTML tags.

However, keep in mind that how you use a tag greatly influences its performance
impact. "Pixels" are highly performant largely because the nature of this tag
type imposes tight restrictions on how they can be used; custom HTML tags aren't
necessarily always bad for performance, but due to the level of freedom they
offer users, they can be easy to misuse in a way that is bad for performance.

When thinking about tags, keep scale in mind: the performance impact of any
single tag may be negligible—but can become significant when tens or hundreds of
tags are used on the same page.


### Not all scripts should be loaded using a tag manager

Tag managers are typically not a good mechanism for loading resources that
implement immediate visual or functional aspects of the user experience—for
example, cookie notices, hero images, or site features. Using a tag manager to
load these resources typically delays their delivery. This is bad for the user
experience and can also increase metrics like LCP and CLS.  In addition, keep in
mind that some users block tag managers. Using a tag manager to implement UX
features may result in a broken website for some of your users.

{% Aside %}

Resources requested via tag manager will typically load later than resources
requested directly. This is not always a bad thing. If a tag manager is
primarily used to deliver non-essential resources, this delay can be used
constructively by providing a mechanism for delaying non-essential requests.

{% endAside %}


### Be careful with Custom HTML tags

[Custom HTML
tags](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107167/custom-tags?hl=en#CustomHTML)
have been around for many years and are heavily used on most sites. Custom HTML
tags allow you to enter your own code with few restrictions. As a result, Custom
HTML tags can be used in a wide variety of ways and their performance impact
varies significantly. When measuring the performance of your site, be aware that
most tools will attribute the performance impact of a Custom HTML tag to the tag
manager that injected it—rather than the tag itself.



{% Img

  alt="Screenshot of creating a custom tag in Google Tag Manager",
  width="800",
  height="470",
  class="screenshot"
%}



Custom HTML tags work by inserting an element into the surrounding page. The act
of inserting elements into the page can be a source of performance issues, and
in some cases, also cause layout shifts.



*   In most situations, if an element is inserted into the page, the browser
    must recalculate the size and position of each item on the page—this process
    is known as
    [layout](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part3#layout).
    The performance impact of a single layout is minimal, but when it occurs
    excessively it can become a source of performance issues. The impact of this
    phenomenon is larger on lower-end devices and pages with a high number of
    DOM elements.
*   If a visible page element is inserted into the DOM after the surrounding
    area has already been rendered, it can cause a layout shift. This phenomenon
    is not unique to tag managers—however, because tags typically load later
    than other parts of the page, it's common for them to be inserted into the
    DOM after the surrounding page has already been rendered.

{% Aside %}

If you're adding or changing visible content on a page, keep in mind that search
engines will need to be able to fetch and process the JavaScript used. For
Google, you can [verify rendering of a
page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/javascript/dynamic-rendering#verify)
for Search; other search engines may have similar testing tools available.

{% endAside %}


### Consider using Custom Templates

[Custom templates](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates) support
some of the same operations as Custom HTML tags but are built upon a sandboxed
version of JavaScript that provides
[APIs](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates/api) for common use
cases like script injection and pixel injection. Due to the greater restrictions
imposed on custom templates, these tags are much less likely to exhibit
performance or security issues; however, for these same reasons, custom
templates will not work for all use cases.



{% Img
  src="image/j2RDdG43oidUy6AL6LovThjeX9c2/QRz6pn83YE6plVivynA7.png",
  alt="Screenshot of using a custom template in Google Tag Manager",
  width="800",
  height="388",
  class="screenshot"
%}



### Inject scripts correctly

Using a tag manager to inject a script is a very common use case. The
recommended way to do this is to use a Custom Template and the
[`injectScript`](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates/api#injectscript)
API.

For information on using the injectScript API to convert an existing Custom HTML
tag, see [Convert an existing
tag](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates/convert-existing-tag).

If you must you use a Custom HTML tag, here are some things to keep in mind:



*   Libraries and large third-party scripts should be loaded via a script tag
    that downloads an external file (for example, `<script
    src="external-scripts.js">`), rather than directly copy-pasting the script's
    contents into the tag. Although forgoing use of the `<script>` tag
    eliminates a separate round-trip to download the script's contents, this
    practice increases container size and prevents the script from being cached
    separately by the browser.
*   Many vendors recommend placing their `<script>` tag at the top of the
    `<head>`. However, for scripts loaded via tag manager, this recommendation
    is usually unnecessary: in most situations, the browser has already finished
    parsing the `<head>` by the time that the tag manager executes.


### Use pixels

In some situations third-party scripts can be replaced with image or iframe
"pixels". Compared to their script-based counterparts, these pixels may support
less functionality; however, because there is no JavaScript execution, they are
also the most performant and secure type of tag. Pixels have a very small
resource size (less than 1&nbsp;KB) and do not cause layout shifts.

Check with your third-party provider for more information on their support for
pixels. Additionally, you can try inspecting their code for a `<noscript>` tag.
If a vendor supports pixels, they will often include them within the
`<noscript>` tag.



{% Img
  src="image/j2RDdG43oidUy6AL6LovThjeX9c2/QMdKBiA8UYcX4V06Lt8V.png",
  alt="Screenshot of custom image tag in Google Tag Manager",
  width="512",
  height="295"
%}



#### Alternatives to pixels

Pixels became popular largely because at one time they were one of the cheapest
and most reliable ways to make a HTTP request in situations where the server
response is not relevant ( for example, when sending data to analytics
providers). The
[`navigator.sendBeacon()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon)
and [`fetch()
keepalive`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters)
APIs are designed to address this same use case but are arguably more reliable
than pixels.

{% Aside %}

The `sendBeacon()` and `fetch() keepalive` APIs will both still work in
situations where the browser is
[unloading](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/unload_event)
the page: for example, both of these APIs can be used to track outbound link
clicks. By contrast, techniques like pixels and
[`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
would likely fail in those cases.

{% endAside %}

There is nothing wrong with continuing to use pixels—they are well supported and
have minimal performance impact. However, if you are building your own beacons,
it is worth considering using one of these APIs.


##### `sendBeacon()`

The
[`navigator.sendBeacon()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon)
API is designed for sending small amounts of data to web servers in situations
where the server response does not matter.

```js
const url = "https://example.com/analytics";
const data = JSON.stringify({
    event: "checkout",
    time: performance.now()
});

navigator.sendBeacon(url, data);

```

`sendBeacon()` has a limited API: it only supports making POST requests and does
not support setting custom headers. It is
[supported](https://caniuse.com/beacon) by all modern browsers.


##### `fetch() keepalive`

[`keepalive`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters)
is a flag that allows the [Fetch
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to
be used to make non-blocking requests like event reporting and analytics. It is
used by including `keepalive: true` in the parameters passed to `fetch()`.

```js
const url = "https://example.com/analytics";
const data = JSON.stringify({
  event: "checkout",
  time: performance.now()
});

fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: data,
    keepalive: true
});
```

If `fetch() keepalive` and `sendBeacon()` seem very similar, it's because they
are. In fact, in Chromium browsers, `sendBeacon()` is now built upon `fetch()
keepalive`.

When choosing between `fetch() keepalive` and `sendBeacon()`, it's important to
consider the features and browser support that you need. The fetch() API is
significantly more flexible; however, `keepalive` has less browser
[support](https://caniuse.com/?search=keepalive) than `sendBeacon()`.


### Get clarification

Tags are often created by following guidance provided by a third-party vendor.
If it is unclear what a vendor's code does—consider asking someone who knows.
Getting a second opinion can help identify if a tag has the potential to create
performance or security issues.


## Triggers

At a high-level, optimizing [tag
triggers](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/topic/7679108?hl=en&ref_topic=7679384)
generally consists of making sure to not trigger tags more than necessary and
choosing a trigger that balances business needs with performance costs.


### Choose an appropriate trigger event

The performance impact of a tag is not fixed: generally speaking, the earlier
that a tag fires, the greater its impact on performance. Resources are typically
constrained during the initial page load and therefore loading or executing a
particular resource (or tag) takes resources away from something else.

Although it is important to choose appropriate triggers for all tags, it is
particularly important for tags that load large resources or execute long
scripts.


### Use custom events

[Custom events](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7679219?hl=en)
allow you to fire triggers in response to page events that aren't covered by
Google Tag Manager's built-in triggers. For example, many tags use [page view
triggers](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7679319?hl=en); however,
the time period between `DOM Ready` and `Window Loaded` can be lengthy on many
pages and this can make it difficult to fine-tune when a tag fires. Custom
events provide a solution to this problem.

To use custom events, first create a custom event trigger and update your tags
to use this trigger.



{% Img
  src="image/j2RDdG43oidUy6AL6LovThjeX9c2/BvkKSJi7PeAONrdKfIXq.png",
  alt="Screenshot of a Custom Event trigger in Google Tag Manager",
  width="512",
  height="286"
%}


To fire the trigger, push the corresponding event to the data layer.

```js
// Custom event trigger that fires after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  dataLayer.push({
    'event' : 'my-custom-event'
  });
}, 2000);
```


### Use specific trigger conditions

Using specific trigger conditions helps avoid firing a tag unnecessarily.
Although there are many ways to apply this concept, one of the simplest yet most
useful things you can do is ensure that a tag only fires on pages where it is
actually used.



{% Img
  src="image/j2RDdG43oidUy6AL6LovThjeX9c2/G3MVBTGhNr560S6zEQu4.png",
  alt="Screenshot showing trigger conditions in Google Tag Manager",
  width="512",
  height="288"
%}


[Built-in variables](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7182738) can
also be incorporated into trigger conditions to limit tag firing.


### Load your tag manager at an appropriate time

Adjusting when you tag manager loads can have a significant impact on
performance. Triggers, regardless of how they are configured, can't fire until
after a tag manager loads. Although it is important to choose good triggers for
individual tags (as explained above), experimenting with when you load your tag
manager can often have an equal or greater impact given that this single
decision will impact all tags on a page.


## Tag Management


### Use the data layer

The [data layer](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/devguide) "contains
all of the information that you want to pass to Google Tag Manager". More
concretely, it is a JavaScript array of objects that contain information about
the page. It can also be used to trigger tags.

```javascript
// Contents of the data layer
window.dataLayer = [{
    'pageCategory': 'signup',
    'visitorType': 'high-value'
  }];

// Pushing a variable to the data layer
window.dataLayer.push({'variable\_name': 'variable\_value'});

// Pushing an event to the data layer
window.dataLayer.push({'event': 'event\_name'});
```

Although Google Tag Manager can be used without the data layer, its use is
strongly recommended. The data layer provides a way to consolidate the data
being accessed by third-party scripts into a single place thereby providing
better visibility into its usage. Amongst other things, this can help reduce
redundant variable calculations and script execution.

{% Aside %}

The performance benefits of the data layer might seem non-intuitive given that
updating the data layer causes Google Tag Manager to reevaluate all container
variables and potentially trigger tags—all of which entails JavaScript
execution. Although it is possible to misuse the data layer, generally speaking,
if working with the data layer is a source of performance issues, it probably
indicates that the container itself has performance issues—the data layer is
merely making these issues more apparent.

{% endAside %}


### Remove duplicate and unused tags

Duplicate tags can occur when a tag is included in a page's HTML markup in
addition to being injected through a tag manager.

Unused tags should be paused or removed rather than blocked through use of a
[trigger exception](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/7679318?hl=en).
Pausing or removing a tag removes the code from the container; blocking does
not.


### Use allow and deny lists

[Allow and deny lists](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/web/restrict)
allow you to configure highly granular restrictions on the tags, triggers, and
variables allowed on a page. This can be used to help enforce performance best
practices and other policies.

Allow and deny lists are configured through the data layer.

```js
window.dataLayer = [{
  'gtm.allowlist': ['&lt;id>', '&lt;id>', ...],
  'gtm.blocklist': ['customScripts']
}];
```


### Consider using server-side tagging

Switching to server-side tagging is not a trivial task, but it is worth
considering - particularly for larger sites that want more control over their
data. Server-side tagging removes vendor code from the client, and with it,
offloads processing from the client to the server.

For example, when using client-side tagging, sending data to multiple analytics
accounts entails that the client initiates separate requests for each endpoint.
By contrast, with server-side tagging, a single request is made by the client to
the server-side container, and from there, this data is forwarded to different
analytics accounts.

Keep in mind that server-side tagging only works with some tags; tag
compatibility varies depending on vendor.

For more information, see [An introduction to server-side
tagging](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/intro).


## Containers


### Use only one container per page

Using multiple
[containers](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/api/v1/reference/accounts/containers)
on a single page can create significant performance issues as it introduces
additional overhead and script execution. It is rare for multiple containers to
be used effectively.

If you must use multiple containers per page, [follow Google Tag manager
guidance for setting up multiple
containers](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/devguide#multiple-containers).


### Use separate containers if needed

If you use a tag manager for multiple properties (for example, a web app and a
mobile app)—the number of containers you use can help or hurt your workflow
productivity. It can also impact performance.

Generally speaking, a single container can effectively be used across multiple
sites if the sites are similar in use and structure. For example, although a
brand's mobile and web apps might serve similar functions, it's likely that the
apps will be structured differently, and therefore more effectively managed
through separate containers. Trying to reuse a single container too broadly
typically unnecessarily increases the complexity and size of the container by
forcing the adoption of complex logic to manage tags and triggers.


### Keep an eye on container size

The size of a container is determined by its tags, triggers, and variables.
Although a small container may negatively impact page performance, a large
container almost certainly will.

Container size should not be your north-star metric when optimizing your tag
usage; however, a large container size is often a warning sign that a container
is not well maintained and possibly misused.

Google Tag Manager
[limits](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/2772488?hl=en) container
size to 200&nbsp;KB and will warn about container size starting at 140&nbsp;KB. However,
most sites should aim to keep their containers far smaller than this. For
perspective, the median site container is around 6&nbsp;KB.

To determine the size of your container, look at the size of the response
returned by `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_ID`. This
response contains the Google Tag Manager library plus the contents of the
container. By itself, the Google Tag Manager library is around 33&nbsp;KB.


### Name your container versions

A [container
version](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/api/v1/reference/accounts/containers/versions)
is a snapshot of a container's content at a particular point in time. Using a
meaningful name and along with including a short description of meaningful
changes within can go a long way in making it easier to debug future performance
issues.


## Tagging workflows


### Test tags before deploying

Testing your tags before deployment can help catch issues (performance and
otherwise) before they ship.

Things to consider when testing a tag include:



*   Is the tag working correctly?
*   Does the tag cause any layout shifts?
*   Does the tag load any resources? How large are these resources?
*   Does the tag trigger a long-running script?


#### Preview mode

[Preview mode](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107056) allows you
to test tag changes on your actual site without having to deploy them to the
public first. Preview mode includes a debugging console that provides
information about tags.

The execution time of Google Tag Manager will be different (slightly slower)
when run in Preview mode due to the additional overhead required to expose
information in the debugging console. Thus, comparing Web Vitals measurements
collected in preview mode to those collected in production is not recommended.
However, this discrepancy should not affect the execution behavior of the tags
themselves.


#### Standalone testing

An alternative approach to testing tags is to set up an empty page containing a
container with a single tag—the tag you are testing. This testing setup is less
realistic and won't catch some issues (for example, whether a tag causes layout
shifts)—however it can make it easier to isolate and measure the impact of the
tag on things like script execution. Check out how [Telegraph uses this
isolation approach to improve
performance](https://medium.com/the-telegraph-engineering/improving-third-party-web-performance-at-the-telegraph-a0a1000be5)
of third-party code.


### Monitor tag performance

The Google Tag Manager [Monitoring
API](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates/monitoring) can be used
to gather information about the [execution
time](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates/monitoring#execution_times)
of a particular tag. This information is reported to an endpoint of your
choosing.

For more information, see [How to build a Google Tag Manager
Monitor](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-monitor/).


### Require approval for container changes

First-party code typically goes through review and testing before deployment -
treat your tags the same. Adding [two-step
verification](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/4525539/tag-manager-and-2-step-verification?hl=en),
which requires administrator approval for container changes, is one way to do
this. Alternatively, if you don't want to require two-step verification but
would still like to keep an eye on changes, you can set up [container
notifications](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9713667?hl=en) to
receive email alerts about container events of your choosing.


### Periodically audit tag usage

One of the challenges of working with tags is that they tend to accumulate over
time: tags get added but are rarely removed. Auditing tags periodically is one
way to reverse this trend. The ideal frequency for doing this will depend on how
often your site's tags are updated.

For more information, see [Keeping third-party scripts under
control](/controlling-third-party-scripts/).
