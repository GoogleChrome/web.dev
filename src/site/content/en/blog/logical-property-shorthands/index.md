Since Chromium 69 (September 3rd 2018), 
[logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) and values have helped 
developers maintain control of their international layouts through logical, rather 
than physical, direction and dimension styles. In Chromium 87, shorthands and 
offsets have shipped to make these logical properties and values a bit easier to write. 
This catches Chromium up to Firefox, which has had support for the shorthands 
[since 66](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/66). 
Safari has them ready in their [tech preview](https://webkit.org/blog/11300/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-114/).

    device frame. Arrows and colors follow the text to help associate the 2 directions 
    of block and inline.">

## Document flow
If you're already familiar with logical properties, inline and block axes, and don't 
want a refresher, you can [skip ahead](#new-shorthands). Otherwise, here's a short refresher.

In English, letters and words flow left to right while paragraphs are stacked top to bottom. 
In traditional Chinese, letters and words are top to bottom while paragraphs are stacked 
right to left. In just these 2 cases, if we write CSS that puts "margin top" on a paragraph, 
we're only appropriately spacing 1 language style. If the page is translated into traditional 
Chinese from English, the margin may well not make sense in the new vertical writing mode.

Therefore the physical side of the box isn't very useful internationally. Thus begins the 
process of supporting multiple languages; learning about physical versus logical sides of the box model. 

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
A _logical property_ is one that references a side, corner or axis of the box model in context 
of the applicable language direction. It's akin to referencing someone's `strong` arm, 
rather than assuming it's their `right` arm. "Right" is a physical arm reference, "strong" is 
a logical arm reference, **contextual to the individual**.
{% endAside %}

Have you ever inspected the `p` element in Chrome DevTools? If so, you might have 
noticed that the [default User Agent styles](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#flow-content-3:~:text=blockquote%2C%20figure%2C%20listing%2C%20p%2C%20plaintext%2C%20pre%2C,%7D) 
are not physical, but logical. 

```css
p {
  margin-block-start: 1em;
  margin-block-end: 1em;
  margin-inline-start: 0px;
  margin-inline-end: 0px;
}
```
<small>CSS from [Chromium's User Agent Stylesheet](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/master/Source/core/css/html.css)</small>

The margin is not on the top or bottom like an English reader might believe. 
It's `block-start` and `block-end`! These logical properties are akin to an English reader's 
top and bottom, but **also** akin to a Japanese reader as right and left. Written once, works everywhere.

Normal flow is when the webpage is part of this multi-directionality intentionally. 
When page content updates according to document direction changes, the layout and its 
elements are considered in flow. Read more about "in" and "out" of flow 
[on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout) or in the 
[CSS Display Module spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-3/#out-of-flow). While logical properties 
are not required to be in flow, they do much of the heavy lifting for you as directionality changes. 
Flow implies direction, which letters, words and content need to travel along. 
This leads us to block and inline logical directions.

Block direction is the direction that new content blocks follow, like asking yourself, 
"where to put the next paragraph?". You might think of it as a "content block", or "block of text". 
Every language arranges their blocks and orders them along 
their respective `block-axis`. `block-start` is the side a paragraph is first placed, 
while `block-end` is the side new paragraphs flow towards. 

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
The _block direction_ is defined by the `writing-mode` property. For example, `horizontal-tb` 
(the initial value) has a vertical block axis that flows top-to-bottom (`tb`). Other values 
have an horizontal block axis, which can flow left-to-right (like in `vertical-lr`) or 
right-to-left (like in `vertical-rl`).
{% endAside %}

In traditional Japanese handwriting, for example, block direction flows right to left:

{% YouTube '5IbOpE9eVnM' %}

Inline direction is the direction that letters and words go. Consider the direction 
your arm and hand travel when you write; they are traveling along the `inline-axis`. 
`inline-start` is the side where you start writing, while `inline-end` is the side 
where writing ends or wraps. The above video, the `inline-axis` is top to bottom, 
but in this next video the `inline-axis` flows right to left.

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
The _inline direction_ is defined by both `writing-mode` and `direction`. For example, 
it flows left-to-right with `horizontal-tb` and `ltr`, right-to-left with `horizontal-tb` 
and `rtl`, top-to-bottom with `vertical-lr` and `ltr`, and bottom-to-top with `vertical-rl` and `rtl`.
{% endAside %}

{% YouTube 'nTzyRdoXlbs' %}

Being [`flow-relative`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-4/#logical-directions) 
means that the styles written for one language will be contextual and appropriately 
applied into other languages. Content will flow relative to the language it's being delivered for.

## New shorthands
Some of the following shorthands are not new features for the browser, rather, easier 
ways to write styles by taking advantage of being able to set values on both block 
or inline edges at once. The `inset-*` logical properties **do** bring new abilities, 
as there were no longhand ways to specify absolute positions with logical properties 
before it. Insets and shorthands flow (hehe) together so well though, I'm going to 
tell you about all of the new logical properties features landing in Chromium 87 at once. 

### Margin shorthands
No new abilities shipped, but some super handy shorthands did: <br>
[`margin-block`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-block) and 
[`margin-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-inline).

{% Glitch 'margin-logical-shorthand' %}

{% Aside 'caution' %}
If the above items do not have space between them, then `margin-block` shorthand is not supported in your browser.
{% endAside %}

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Longhand' %}
```css
margin-block-start: 2ch;
margin-block-end: 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New shorthand' %}
```css
margin-block: 2ch;
/* or */
margin-block: 2ch 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

There is no shorthand for "top and bottom" or "left and right"… until now! 
You probably reference all 4 sides using the shorthand of `margin: 10px;`, and now you 
can easily reference 2 complimentary sides by using the logical property shorthand.

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Longhand' %}
```css
margin-inline-start: 4ch;
margin-inline-end: 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New shorthand' %}
```css
margin-inline: 4ch 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

### Padding shorthands
No new abilities shipped, but more super handy shorthands did: <br>
[`padding-block`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-block) and 
[`padding-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-inline).

{% Glitch 'padding-logical-shorthand' %}

<br>

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Longhand' %}
```css
padding-block-start: 2ch;
padding-block-end: 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New shorthand' %}
```css
padding-block: 2ch;
/* or */
padding-block: 2ch 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

And the `inline` complimentary set of shorthands:

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Longhand' %}
```css
padding-inline-start: 4ch;
padding-inline-end: 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New shorthand' %}
```css
padding-inline: 4ch 2ch;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

### Inset and shorthands
The physical properties `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` can all be written 
as values for the `inset` property. Any value of `position`  can benefit from 
setting sides with inset.

```css//2-5
.cover {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  inset: 0;
}
```

{% Glitch 'inset-logical-shorthand' %}

<br>

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Physical longhand' %}
```css
position: absolute;
top: 1px;
right: 2px;
bottom: 3px;
left: 4px;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New physical shorthand' %}
```css
position: absolute;
inset: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

That should look immediately convenient! Inset is shorthand for the physical sides, 
and it works just like margin and padding. 

#### New features
As exciting as the physical sides shorthand is, there's even more from the 
logical features brought by additional `inset` shorthands. These shorthands bring 
developer authoring convenience (they're shorter to type) but also increase 
the potential reach for the layout because they're flow-relative.

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Physical longhand' %}
```css
position: absolute;
top: 10px;
bottom: 10px;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Logical shorthand' %}
```css
position: absolute;
inset-block: 10px;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

<br>

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Physical longhand' %}
```css
position: absolute;
left: 10px;
right: 20px;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Logical shorthand' %}
```css
position: absolute;
inset-inline: 10px 20px;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

is available on MDN.

### Border shorthands
Border, plus its nested `color`, `style`, and `width` properties have all got 
new logical shorthands as well.

{% Glitch 'border-logical-shorthand' %}

<br>

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Physical longhand' %}
```css
border-top-color: hotpink;
border-bottom-color: hotpink;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Logical shorthand' %}
```css
border-block-color: hotpink;
/* or */
border-block-color: hotpink hotpink;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

<br>

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Physical longhand' %}
```css
border-left-style: dashed;
border-right-style: dashed;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Logical shorthand' %}
```css
border-inline-style: dashed;
/* or */
border-inline-style: dashed dashed;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

<br>

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Physical longhand' %}
```css
border-left-width: 1px;
border-right-width: 1px;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Logical shorthand' %}
```css
border-inline-width: 1px;
/* or */
border-inline-width: 1px 1px;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

## Logical property `<figure>` example
Let's put it all together in a small example. Logical properties can layout 
an image with a caption to handle different writing and document directions.

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--fullbleed">
  <video playsinline controls autoplay loop muted class="w-screenshot">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/atoms-sandbox.google.com.a.appspot.com/logical-property-figure-demo.mp4">
  </video>
</figure> 

Or try it!

{% Glitch 'logical-figure' %}

You don't have to do much to make a card internationally responsive with a 
`<figure>` and a few logical properties. If you're curious how all this internationally 
considerate CSS works together, I hope this is a small meaningful introduction.

### Polyfilling and cross-browser support {: #browser-compatibility }

The Cascade or build tools are viable options to have old and new browsers alike, 
properly spaced with updated logical properties. For Cascade fallbacks, follow a physical property 
with a logical one and the browser will use the "last" property it found during style 
resolution. 

```css
p {
  /* for unsupporting browsers */
  margin-top: 1ch;
  margin-bottom: 2ch;
  
  /* for supporting browsers to use */
  /* and unsupporting browsers to ignore and go 🤷‍♂️ */
  margin-block: 1ch 2ch;
}
```

That's not quite a full solution for everyone though. Here's a handwritten fallback 
that leverages the `:lang()` pseudo-selector to target specific languages, adjusts 
their physical spacing appropriately, then at the end offers the logical 
spacing for supporting browsers:

```css
/* physical side styles */
p {
  margin-top: 1ch;
  margin-bottom: 2ch;
}

/* adjusted physical side styles per language */
:lang(ja) {
  p {
    /* zero out styles not useful for traditional Japanese */
    margin-top: 0;
    margin-bottom: 0;

    /* add appropriate styles for traditional Japanese */
    margin-right: 1ch;
    margin-left: 2ch;
  }
}

/* add selectors and adjust for languages all supported */
:lang(he) {…}
:lang(mn) {…}

/* Logical Sides */
/* Then, for supporting browsers to use */
/* and unsupporting browsers to ignore #TheCascade */
p {
  /* remove any potential physical cruft.. */
  margin: 0;
  /* explicitly set logical value */
  margin-block: 1ch 2ch;
}
```

You could also use `@supports` to determine whether or not to provide physical 
property fallbacks:

```css
p {
  margin-top: 1ch; 
  margin-bottom: 2ch;
}

@supports (margin-block: 0) {
  p {
    margin-block: 1ch 2ch;
  }
}
```

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [PostCSS](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-logical), 
[Emotion](https://emotion.sh) and others have automated bundler and/or build 
time offerings that have a wide array of fallbacks or solutions. Check out each one 
to see which matches your toolchain and overall site strategy.

## What's next
More of CSS will offer logical properties, it's not done yet! There's one big missing 
set of shorthands though, and a resolution is still pending in this [Github issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1282). 
There is a temporary solution [in a draft](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-logical/#logical-shorthand-keyword). What if you want to style all 
logical sides of a box with a shorthand?

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Physical shorthand' %}
```css
margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
margin: 1px 2px;
margin: 2px;
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Logical shorthand' %}
```css
margin: logical 1px 2px 3px 4px;
margin: logical 1px 2px;
margin: logical 2px;
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

The current draft proposal would mean you have to write `logical` in every 
shorthand in order to get the logical equivalent applied, which doesn't sound 
very [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) to some. 

There are other proposals to change it at the block or page level, 
but that could leak logical uses into styles still assuming physical sides.

```css
html {
  flow-mode: physical; 
  /* or */
  flow-mode: logical;
  /* now all margin/padding/etc references are logical */
}

/* hopefully no 3rd/1st party code is hard coded to top/left/etc ..? */
```
 
It's a tough one! Cast your vote, voice your opinion, we want to hear from you.
