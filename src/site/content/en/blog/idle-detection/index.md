The Idle Detection API is part of the
[capabilities project](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities)
and is currently in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses.

## What is the Idle Detection API? {: #what }

The Idle Detection API notifies developers when a user is idle, indicating such things as lack of
interaction with the keyboard, mouse, screen, activation of a screensaver, locking of the screen,
or moving to a different screen. A developer-defined threshold triggers the notification.

### Suggested use cases for the Idle Detection API {: #use-cases }

Examples of sites that may use this API include:

- Chat applications or online social networking sites can use this API to let the user know if
their contacts are currently reachable.
- Publicly exposed kiosk apps, for example in museums, can use this API to return to the "home"
view if no one interacts with the kiosk anymore.
- Apps that require expensive calculations, for example to draw charts,
can limit these calculations to moments when the user interacts with their device.

## How to use the Idle Detection API {: #use }

### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with the Idle Detection API locally, without an origin trial token, enable the
`#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` flag in `chrome://flags`.

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

Starting with Chrome&nbsp;84, the Idle Detection API will be available as an origin trial.
The origin trial is expected to end in Chrome&nbsp;86.

{% include 'content/origin-trials.njk' %}

### Register for the origin trial {: #register-for-ot }

{% include 'content/origin-trial-register.njk' %}

### Feature detection

To check if the Idle Detection API is supported, use:

```javascript
if ('IdleDetector' in window) {
  // Idle Detector API supported
}
```

### Idle Detection API concepts

The Idle Detection API assumes that there is some level of engagement between the user,
the user agent (that is, the browser), and the operating system of the device in use.
This is represented in two dimensions:

- **The user idle state:**
  `active` or `idle`: the user has or has not
interacted with the user agent for some period of time.
- **The screen idle state:**
  `locked` or `unlocked`: the system has an active screen lock (like a screensaver) preventing
  interaction with the user agent.

Distinguishing `active` from `idle` requires heuristics that may differ across user, user agent,
and operating system. It should also be a reasonably coarse threshold
(see [Security and Permissions](#security-and-permissions)).

The model intentionally does not formally distinguish between interaction with particular content
(that is, the webpage in a tab using the API), the user agent as a whole, or the operating system;
this definition is left to the user agent.

### Using the Idle Detection API

The first step when using the Idle Detection API is
to ensure the `'idle-detection'` permission is granted.
If the permission is not granted, you need to
request it via `IdleDetector.requestPermission()`.

```js
// Make sure 'idle-detection' permission is granted.
const state = await IdleDetector.requestPermission();
if (state !== 'granted') {
  // Need to request permission first.
  return console.log('Idle detection permission not granted.');
}
```

{% Aside %}
  Initially, idle detection was gated behind the
  notifications permission.
  While many, but not all, use cases of this API
  involve notifications, the Idle Detection spec editors have decided to gate it
  behind a dedicated idle detection permission.
{% endAside %}

The second step is then to instantiate the `IdleDetector`.
The minimum `threshold` is 60,000 milliseconds (1 minute).
You can finally start the idle detection by calling the
`IdleDetector`'s `start()` method.
It takes an object with the desired idle `threshold` in milliseconds
and an optional `signal` with an
[`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
to abort idle detection as parameters.

```js
try {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const signal = controller.signal;

  const idleDetector = new IdleDetector();
  idleDetector.addEventListener('change', () => {
    const userState = idleDetector.userState;
    const screenState = idleDetector.screenState;
    console.log(`Idle change: ${userState}, ${screenState}.`);
  });

  await idleDetector.start({
    threshold: 60000,
    signal,
  });
  console.log('IdleDetector is active.');
} catch (err) {
  // Deal with initialization errors like permission denied,
  // running outside of top-level frame, etc.
  console.error(err.name, err.message);
}
```

You can abort the idle detection by calling the
[`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)'s
[`abort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController/abort)
method.

```js
controller.abort();
console.log('IdleDetector is stopped.');
```

### DevTools support

Starting in Chrome&nbsp;86, you can emulate idle events in Chrome DevTools without actually being idle.
In DevTools, open the **Sensors** tab and look for **Emulate Idle Detector state**.
You can see the various options in the video below.

### Puppeteer support

As of Puppeteer version&nbsp;5.3.1, you can
[emulate the various idle states](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#pageemulateidlestateoverrides)
to programmatically test how your web app's behavior changes.

### Demo

You can see the Idle Detection API in action with the [Ephemeral Canvas demo][demo] that erases its
contents after 60 seconds of inactivity. You could imagine this being deployed in a department
store for kids to doodle on.

### Polyfilling

Some aspects of the Idle Detection API are polyfillable
and idle detection libraries like [idle.ts](https://github.com/dropbox/idle.ts) exist,
but these approaches are constrained to a web app's own content area:
The library running in the context of the web app
needs to expensively poll for input events or listen to visibility changes.
More restrictively, though, libraries cannot tell today when a user goes idle
outside of its content area (e.g., when a user is on a different tab
or logged out of their computer altogether).

## Security and permissions {: #security-and-permissions }

The Chrome team has designed and implemented the Idle Detection API using the core principles
defined in [Controlling Access to Powerful Web Platform Features][powerful-apis],
including user control, transparency, and ergonomics.
The ability to use this API is controlled by the
[`'idle-detection'` permission](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#permission-registry).
In order to use the API, an app also must be running in a
[top-level secure context](https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#examples-top-level).

### User control and privacy

We always want to prevent malicious actors from misusing new APIs. Seemingly independent websites,
but that in fact are controlled by the same entity, might obtain user idle information and
correlate the data to identify unique users across origins. To mitigate these sort of attacks,
the Idle Detection API limits the granularity of the reported idle events.
