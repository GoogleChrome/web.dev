High-quality documentation for web platform technologies is a critically
important component of our shared, open digital infrastructure. Today, I'm
excited to publicly introduce [Open Web Docs][home], a collective project
between Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Coil, W3C, Samsung, and Igalia. It is
designed to support a community of technical writers around strategic creation
and long-term maintenance of web platform technology documentation that is open
and inclusive for all. 

This is not a new docs platform: Open Web Docs is instead working closely with
existing platforms, and its current priority is contributions to [MDN Web
Docs][mdn]. It was created to ensure the long-term health of web platform
documentation on de facto standard resources, independently of any single vendor
or organization. Through full-time staff, community management, and Open Web
Docs' network of partner organizations, it enables these resources to better
maintain and sustain documentation of core web platform technologies. Rather
than create new documentation sites, Open Web Docs is committed to improving
existing platforms through our contributions.
