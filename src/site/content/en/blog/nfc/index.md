Web apps should be able to do anything native apps can. The [Capabilities
project](/fugu-status/), of which Web NFC is only a part, aims to do just that.
To learn about other capabilities and to keep up with their progress, follow
[Unlocking new capabilities for the web](/fugu-status/).

## What is Web NFC? {: #what }

NFC stands for Near Field Communications, a short-range wireless technology
operating at 13.56 MHz that enables communication between devices at a distance
less than 10 cm and a transmission rate of up to 424 kbit/s.

Web NFC provides sites the ability to read and write to NFC tags when they are
in close proximity to the user's device (usually 5-10 cm, 2-4 inches).
The current scope is limited to NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF), a lightweight
binary message format that works across different tag formats.

  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Diagram of an NFC operation</figcaption>
</figure>

## Suggested use cases {: #use-cases }

Web NFC is limited to NDEF because the security properties of reading and
writing NDEF data are more easily quantifiable. Low-level I/O operations (e.g.
ISO-DEP, NFC-A/B, NFC-F) and Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) are not supported.

Examples of sites that may use Web NFC include:
- Museums and art galleries can display additional information about a display
  when the user touches their device to an NFC card near the exhibit.
- Inventory management sites can read or write data to the NFC tag on a
  container to update information on its contents.
- Conference sites can use it to scan NFC badges during the event.
- Sites can use it for sharing initial secrets needed for device or service
  provisioning scenarios and also to deploy configuration data in operational
  mode.

## Using Web NFC {: #use }

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

Web NFC will be available on Android as an origin trial in Chrome 81. The origin
trial is expected to end in Chrome 84.

{% include 'content/origin-trials.njk' %}

### Register for the origin trial {: #register-for-ot }

{% include 'content/origin-trial-register.njk' %}

### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with Web NFC locally on Android, without an origin trial token,
enable the `#enable-webnfc` flag in `chrome://flags`.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./chrome-flag.png" alt="Screenshot of the chrome://flags internal page to enable for Web NFC on Android">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Experimental flag for Web NFC on Android</figcaption>
</figure>

### Feature detection {: #feature-detection }

Feature detection for hardware is different from what you're probably used to.
The presence of `NDEFReader` and `NDEFWriter` tells you that the browser
supports Web NFC, but not whether the required hardware is present. In
particular, if the hardware is missing, the promised returned by certain calls
will reject. I'll provide details when I describe `NDEFReader` and `NDEFWriter`.

```js
if ('NDEFReader' in window) { /* Scan NFC tags */ }
if ('NDEFWriter' in window) { /* Write NFC tags */ }
```

### Terminology {: #terminology }

An NFC tag is a passive NFC device, meaning that is powered by magnetic
induction when an active NFC device (.e.g a phone) is in proximity. NFC tags
come in many forms and fashions, as stickers, credit cards, arm wrists, etc.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./nfc-tag.jpg" alt="Photo of a transparent NFC tag">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">A transparent NFC tag</figcaption>
</figure>

The `NDEFReader` and `NDEFWriter` objects are the two entry points in Web NFC
that expose functionality for preparing reading and/or writing actions that are
fulfilled when an NDEF tag comes in proximity. The `NDEF` in `NDEFReader` and
`NDEFWriter` stands for NFC Data Exchange Format, a lightweight binary message
format standardized by the [NFC Forum].

The `NDEFReader` object is for acting on incoming NDEF messages from NFC tags
while the `NDEFWriter` object is for writing NDEF messages to NFC tags within
range.

An NFC tag that supports NDEF is like a post-it note. Anyone can read it, and
unless it is read-only, anyone can write to it. It contains a single NDEF
message which encapsulates one or more NDEF records. Each NDEF record is a
binary structure that contains a data payload, and associated type information.
Web NFC supports the following NFC Forum standardized record types: empty, text,
URL, smart poster, MIME type, absolute URL, external type, unknown, and local
type.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./ndef-message-diagram.png" alt="Diagram of an NDEF message">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Diagram of an NDEF message</figcaption>
</figure>

### Scan NFC tags {: #scan }

To scan NFC tags, first instantiate a new `NDEFReader` object. Calling `scan()`
returns a promise. The [user may be prompted] if access was not previously
granted. The promise will resolve if the following conditions are all met:

- User has allowed the website to interact with NFC devices when they tap their
  phone.
- The user's phone supports NFC.
- The user has enabled NFC on their phone.

Once the promise is resolved, incoming NDEF messages are available by
subscribing to "reading" events via an event listener. You should also subscribe
to "error" events to be notified when incompatible NFC tags are in proximity
range.

```js
const reader = new NDEFReader();
reader.scan().then(() => {
  console.log("Scan started successfully.");
  reader.onerror = () => {
    console.log("Cannot read data from the NFC tag. Try another one?");
  };
  reader.onreading = event => {
    console.log("NDEF message read.");
  };
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(`Error! Scan failed to start: ${error}.`);
});
```

When an NFC tag is in proximity, a `NDEFReadingEvent` event is fired. It
contains two properties unique to it:

- `serialNumber` represents the serial number of the device (.e.g
  00-11-22-33-44-55-66), or an empty string if none is available.
- `message` represents the NDEF message stored in the NFC tag.

To read the content of the NDEF message, loop through `message.records` and
process their `data` members [appropriately] based on their `recordType`.
The `data` member is exposed as a <code>[DataView]</code> as it allows handling
cases where data is encoded in UTF-16.

```js
reader.onreading = event => {
  const message = event.message;
  for (const record of message.records) {
    console.log("Record type:  " + record.recordType);
    console.log("MIME type:    " + record.mediaType);
    console.log("Record id:    " + record.id);
    switch (record.recordType) {
      case "text":
        // TODO: Read text record with record data, lang, and encoding.
        break;
      case "url":
        // TODO: Read URL record with record data.
        break;
      default:
        // TODO: Handle other records with record data.
    }
  }
};
```



{% Aside %}
The [cookbook](#cookbook) contains many examples of how to read NDEF records based on
their types.
{% endAside %}

You can also filter NDEF messages by passing options to `scan()`.

- `id` matches the record identifier of each NDEFRecord.
- `recordType` matches the type of each NDEFRecord.
- `mediaType` pattern matches the `mediaType` property of each NDEFRecord.

```js
// Accept only NDEF messages with JSON content
const reader = new NDEFReader();
await reader.scan({
  mediaType: "application/*json"  // pattern matching any JSON-based MIME type
});
```

```js
// Accept only NDEF messages with binary content and a custom record identifier
const reader = new NDEFReader();
await reader.scan({
  id: "my-restaurant-daily-menu",
  mediaType: "application/octet-stream"
});
```

```js
// Accept only NDEF messages with custom external type
const reader = new NDEFReader();
await reader.scan({
  recordType: "example.com:shoppingItem"
});
```

### Write NFC tags {: #write }

To write NFC tags, first instantiate a new `NDEFWriter` object. Calling
`write()` returns a promise. The [user may be prompted] if access was not
previously granted. At this point, an NDEF message is "prepared" and promise
will resolve if the following conditions are all met:

- User has allowed the website to interact with NFC devices when they tap their
  phone.
- The user's phone supports NFC.
- The user has enabled NFC on their phone.
- User has tapped an NFC tag and an NDEF message has been successfully written.

To write text to an NFC tag, pass a string to the `write()` method.

```js
const writer = new NDEFWriter();
writer.write(
  "Hello World"
).then(() => {
  console.log("Message written.");
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(`Write failed :-( try again: ${error}.`);
});
```

To write a URL record to an NFC tag, pass a dictionary that represents an NDEF
message to `write()`. In the example below, the NDEF message is a dictionary
with a `records` key. Its value is an array of records - in this case, a URL
record defined as an object with a `recordType` key set to `"url"` and a `data`
key set to the URL string.

```js
const writer = new NDEFWriter();
writer.write({
  records: [{ recordType: "url", data: "https://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/" }]
}).then(() => {
  console.log("Message written.");
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(`Write failed :-( try again: ${error}.`);
});
```

It is also possible to write multiple records to an NFC tag.

```js
const writer = new NDEFWriter();
writer.write({ records: [
    { recordType: "url", data: "https://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/" },
    { recordType: "url", data: "https://web.dev/nfc/" }
]}).then(() => {
  console.log("Message written.");
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(`Write failed :-( try again: ${error}.`);
});
```

{% Aside %}
The [cookbook](#cookbook) contains many examples of how to write other types of
NDEF records.
{% endAside %}

If an NFC tag should be read while performing an NFC write operation, set the
`ignoreRead` property to `false` in the options passed to the `write()` method.

```js
const reader = new NDEFReader();
reader.scan().then(() => {

  reader.onreading = event => {
    // TODO: Handle incoming NDEF messages.
  };

  const writer = new NDEFWriter();
  return writer.write("Writing data is fun!", { ignoreRead: false });

}).catch(error => {
  console.log(`Write failed :-( try again: ${error}.`);
});
```

If the NFC tag contains an NDEF message that is not meant to be overwritten, set
the `overwrite` property to `false` in the options passed to the `write()`
method. In that case, the returned promise will reject if an NDEF message is
already stored in the NFC tag.

```js
const writer = new NDEFWriter();
writer.write("Writing data on an empty NFC tag is fun!", { overwrite: false })
.then(() => {
  console.log("Message written.");
}).catch(_ => {
  console.log(`Write failed :-( try again: ${error}.`);
});
```

### Security and permissions {: #security-and-permissions }

The Chrome team has designed and implemented Web NFC using the core principles
defined in [Controlling Access to Powerful Web Platform
Features][powerful-apis], including user control, transparency, and ergonomics.

Because NFC expands the domain of information potentially available to malicious
websites, the availability of NFC is restricted to maximize users' awareness and
control over NFC use.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./nfc-prompt.png" alt="Screenshot of a Web NFC prompt on a website">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Web NFC user prompt</figcaption>
</figure>

Web NFC is only available to top-level frames and secure browsing contexts (HTTPS
only). Origins must first request the `"nfc"` [permission] while handling a
user gesture (e.g a button click). The NDEFReader `scan()` and NDEFWriter
`write()` methods trigger a user prompt, if access was not previously granted.

```js
  document.querySelector("#scanButton").onclick = async () => {
    const reader = new NDEFReader();
    // Prompt user to allow website to interact with NFC devices.
    await reader.scan();
    reader.onreading = event => {
      // TODO: Handle incoming NDEF messages.
    };
  };
```

The combination of a user-initiated permission prompt and real-world, physical
movement of bringing the device over a target NFC tag mirrors the chooser
pattern found in the other file and device-access APIs.

To perform a scan or write, the web page must be visible when the user touches
an NFC tag with their device. The browser uses haptic feedback to indicate a
tap. Access to the NFC radio is blocked if the display is off or the device is
locked. For non visible web pages, receiving and pushing NFC content are
suspended, and resumed when a web page becomes visible again.

Thanks to the [Page Visibility API], it is possible to track when document
visibility changes.

```js
document.onvisibilitychange = event => {
  if (document.hidden) {
    // All NFC operations are automatically suspended when document is hidden.
  } else {
    // All NFC operations are resumed, if needed.
  }
};
```

## Cookbook {: #cookbook }

Here's some code samples to get you started.

### Check for permission

The [Permissions API] allows checking whether the `"nfc"` permission was
granted. This example shows how to scan NFC tags without user interaction if
access was previously granted, or show a button otherwise. Note that the same
mechanism works for writing NFC tags as it uses the same permission under the
hood.

```js
const reader = new NDEFReader();

async function startScanning() {
  await reader.scan();
  reader.onreading = event => {
    /* handle NDEF messages */
  };
}

const nfcPermissionStatus = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: "nfc" });
if (permissionStatus.state === "granted") {
  // NFC access was previously granted, so we can start NFC scanning now.
  startScanning();
} else {
  // Show a "scan" button.
  document.querySelector("#scanButton").style.display = "block";
  document.querySelector("#scanButton").onclick = event => {
    // Prompt user to allow UA to send and receive info when they tap NFC devices.
    startScanning();
  };
}
```

### Abort NFC operations

Using the <code>[AbortController]</code> primitive makes it easy to abort NFC operations. The
example below shows you how to pass the `signal` of an AbortController through
the options of NDEFReader `scan()` and NDEFWriter `write()` methods and abort
both NFC operations at the same time.

```js
const abortController = new AbortController();
abortController.signal.onabort = event => {
  // All NFC operations have been aborted.
};

const reader = new NDEFReader();
await reader.scan({ signal: abortController.signal });

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.push("Hello world", { signal: abortController.signal });

document.querySelector("#abortButton").onclick = event => {
  abortController.abort();
};
```

### Read and write a text record

The text record `data` can be decoded with a `TextDecoder` instantiated with the
record `encoding` property. Note that the language of the text record is
available through its `lang` property.

```js
function readTextRecord(record) {
  console.assert(record.recordType === "text");
  const textDecoder = new TextDecoder(record.encoding);
  console.log(`Text: ${textDecoder.decode(record.data)} (${record.lang})`);
}
```

To write a simple text record, pass a string to the NDEFWriter `write()` method.

```js
const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write("Hello World");
```

Text records are UTF-8 by default and assume the current document's language but
both properties (`encoding` and `lang`) can be specified using the full syntax
for creating a custom NDEF record.

```js
function a2utf16(string) {
  let result = new Uint16Array(string.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    result[i] = string.codePointAt(i);
  }
  return result;
}

const textRecord = {
  recordType: "text",
  lang: "fr",
  encoding: "utf-16",
  data: a2utf16("Bonjour, François !")
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write({ records: [textRecord] });
```

### Read and write a URL record

Use `TextDecoder` to decode the record's `data`.

```js
function readUrlRecord(record) {
  console.assert(record.recordType === "url");
  const textDecoder = new TextDecoder();
  console.log(`URL: ${textDecoder.decode(record.data)}`);
}
```

To write a URL record, pass an NDEF message dictionary to the NDEFWriter
`write()` method. The URL record contained in the NDEF message is defined as an
object with a `recordType` key set to `"url"` and a `data` key set to the URL
string.

```js
const urlRecord = {
  recordType: "url",
  data:"https://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/"
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write({ records: [urlRecord] });
```

### Read and write a MIME type record

The `mediaType` property of a MIME type record represents the MIME type of the
NDEF record payload so that `data` can be properly decoded. For instance, use
`JSON.parse` to decode JSON text and an Image element to decode image data.

```js
function readMimeRecord(record) {
  console.assert(record.recordType === "mime");
  if (record.mediaType === "application/json") {
    const textDecoder = new TextDecoder();
    console.log(`JSON: ${JSON.parse(decoder.decode(record.data))}`);
  }
  else if (record.mediaType.startsWith('image/')) {
    const blob = new Blob([record.data], { type: record.mediaType });
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    document.body.appendChild(img);
  }
  else {
    // TODO: Handle other MIME types.
  }
}
```

To write a MIME type record, pass an NDEF message dictionary to the NDEFWriter
`write()` method. The MIME type record contained in the NDEF message is defined
as an object with a `recordType` key set to `"mime"`, a `mediaType` key set to
the actual MIME type of the content, and a `data` key set to an object that can
be either an `ArrayBuffer` or provides a view on to an `ArrayBuffer` (e.g.
`Uint8Array`, `DataView`).

```js
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const data = {
  firstname: "François",
  lastname: "Beaufort"
};
const jsonRecord = {
  recordType: "mime",
  mediaType: "application/json",
  data: encoder.encode(JSON.stringify(data))
};

const imageRecord = {
  recordType: "mime",
  mediaType: "image/png",
  data: await (await fetch("icon1.png")).arrayBuffer()
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write({ records: [jsonRecord, imageRecord] });
```

### Read and write an absolute-URL record

The absolute-URL record `data` can be decoded with a simple `TextDecoder`.

```js
function readAbsoluteUrlRecord(record) {
  console.assert(record.recordType === "absolute-url");
  const textDecoder = new TextDecoder();
  console.log(`Absolute URL: ${textDecoder.decode(record.data)}`);
}
```

To write an absolute URL record, pass an NDEF message dictionary to the
NDEFWriter `write()` method. The absolute-URL record contained in the NDEF
message is defined as an object with a `recordType` key set to `"absolute-url"`
and a `data` key set to the URL string.

```js
const absoluteUrlRecord = {
  recordType: "absolute-url",
  data:"https://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/"
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write({ records: [absoluteUrlRecord] });
```

### Read and write a smart poster record

A smart poster record (used in magazine advertisements, fliers, billboards,
etc.), describes some web content as an NDEF record that contains an NDEF
message as its payload. Call `record.toRecords()` to transform `data` to a list
of records contained in the smart poster record. It should have a URL record, a
text record for the title, a MIME type record for the image, and some [custom
local type records] such as `":t"`, `":act"`, and `":s"` respectively for the
type, action, and size of the smart poster record.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Smart poster records will be supported in a later version of Chrome.
{% endAside %}

Local type records are unique only within the local context of the containing
NDEF record. Use them when the meaning of the types doesn't matter outside
of the local context of the containing record and when storage usage is a hard
constraint. Local type record names always start with `:` in Web NFC (e.g.
`":t"`, `":s"`, `":act"`). This is to differentiate a text record from a local
type text record for instance.

```js
function readSmartPosterRecord(smartPosterRecord) {
  console.assert(record.recordType === "smart-poster");
  let action, text, url;

  for (const record of smartPosterRecord.toRecords()) {
    if (record.recordType == "text") {
      const decoder = new TextDecoder(record.encoding);
      text = decoder.decode(record.data);
    } else if (record.recordType == "url") {
      const decoder = new TextDecoder();
      url = decoder.decode(record.data);
    } else if (record.recordType == ":act") {
      action = record.data.getUint8(0);
    } else {
      // TODO: Handle other type of records such as `:t`, `:s`.
    }
  }

  switch (action) {
    case 0:
      // Do the action
      break;
    case 1:
      // Save for later
      break;
    case 2:
      // Open for editing
      break;
  }
}
```

To write a smart poster record, pass an NDEF message to the NDEFWriter `write()`
method. The smart poster record contained in the NDEF message is defined as an
object with a `recordType` key set to `"smart-poster"` and a `data` key set to
an object that represents (once again) an NDEF message contained in the
smart poster record.

```js
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const smartPosterRecord = {
  recordType: "smart-poster",
  data: {
    records: [
      {
        recordType: "url", // URL record for smart poster content
        data: "https://my.org/content/19911"
      },
      {
        recordType: "text", // title record for smart poster content
        data: "Funny dance"
      },
      {
        recordType: ":t", // type record, a local type to smart poster
        data: encoder.encode("image/gif") // MIME type of smart poster content
      },
      {
        recordType: ":s", // size record, a local type to smart poster
        data: new Uint32Array([4096]) // byte size of smart poster content
      },
      {
        recordType: ":act", // action record, a local type to smart poster
        // do the action, in this case open in the browser
        data: new Uint8Array([0])
      },
      {
        recordType: "mime", // icon record, a MIME type record
        mediaType: "image/png",
        data: await (await fetch("icon1.png")).arrayBuffer()
      },
      {
        recordType: "mime", // another icon record
        mediaType: "image/jpg",
        data: await (await fetch("icon2.jpg")).arrayBuffer()
      }
    ]
  }
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write({ records: [smartPosterRecord] });
```

### Read and write an external type record

To create application defined records, use external type records. These may
contain an NDEF message as payload that is accessible with `toRecords()`. Their
name contains the domain name of the issuing organization, a colon and a type
name that is at least one character long, for instance `"example.com:foo"`.

```js
function readExternalTypeRecord(externalTypeRecord) {
  for (const record of externalTypeRecord.toRecords()) {
    if (record.recordType == "text") {
      const decoder = new TextDecoder(record.encoding);
      console.log(`Text: ${textDecoder.decode(record.data)} (${record.lang})`);
    } else if (record.recordType == "url") {
      const decoder = new TextDecoder();
      console.log(`URL: ${decoder.decode(record.data)}`);
    } else {
      // TODO: Handle other type of records.
    }
  }
}
```

To write an external type record, pass an NDEF message dictionary to the
NDEFWriter `write()` method. The external type record contained in the NDEF
message is defined as an object with a `recordType` key set to the name of the
external type and a `data` key set to an object that represents an NDEF message
contained in the external type record. Note that the `data` key can also be
either an `ArrayBuffer` or provides a view on to an `ArrayBuffer` (e.g.
`Uint8Array`, `DataView`).

```js
const externalTypeRecord = {
  recordType: "example.game:a",
  data: {
    records: [
      {
        recordType: "url",
        data: "https://example.game/42"
      },
      {
        recordType: "text",
        data: "Game context given here"
      },
      {
        recordType: "mime",
        mediaType: "image/png",
        data: await (await fetch("image.png")).arrayBuffer()
      }
    ]
  }
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
writer.write({ records: [externalTypeRecord] });
```

### Read and write an empty record

An empty record has no payload.

To write an empty record, pass an NDEF message dictionary to the NDEFWriter
`write()` method. The empty record contained in the NDEF message is defined as
an object with a `recordType` key set to `"empty"`.

```js
const emptyRecord = {
  recordType: "empty"
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write({ records: [emptyRecord] });
```

## Dev Tips

Here's a list of things I wish I had known when I started playing with Web NFC:

- Android natively handles NFC tags before Web NFC is operational.
- You can find an NFC icon on [material.io].
- Use NDEF record `id` to easily identifying a record when needed.
- An unformatted NFC tag that supports NDEF contains a single record of the empty type.
- Writing an [android application record] is easy, as shown below.

```js
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const aarRecord = {
  recordType: "android.com:pkg",
  data: encoder.encode("com.example.myapp")
};

const writer = new NDEFWriter();
await writer.write({ records: [aarRecord] });
```
