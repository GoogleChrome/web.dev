Today we are excited to announce the latest in our series of courses on web.dev. [Learn HTML](/learn/html/) is a brand new course written by [Estelle Weyl](https://twitter.com/estellevw) that will take you through all you need to know about HTML today.

We're landing the first five modules today, the rest will follow in staged launches over the next couple of months. You can work through these modules beginning to end, or dip into those that interest you. Even if you have been working on the web for years, you'll discover things you didn't know. HTML is a Living Standard, constantly evolving to meet the needs of the web, so it's worth revisiting it from time to time.

Learn HTML joins our existing courses:

- [Learn CSS](/learn/css/)
- [Learn Responsive Design](/learn/design/)
- [Learn Forms](/learn/forms/)
- [Learn PWA](/learn/pwa/)

Watch this space for more opportunities to learn key web development skills, coming up very soon!
