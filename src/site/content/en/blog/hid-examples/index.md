The WebHID API is part of the [capabilities
project](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities) and is
currently in development. This post will be updated as the implementation
progresses.

## What is the WebHID API? {: #what }

There is a long tail of human interface devices (HIDs) that are too new, too
old, or too uncommon to be accessible by systems' device drivers. The WebHID API
solves this by providing a way to implement device-specific logic in JavaScript.

### Suggested use cases for the WebHID API {: #use-cases }

An HID takes input from or provides output to humans. Examples of devices
include keyboards, pointing devices (mice, touchscreens, etc.), and gamepads.
The [HID protocol](https://www.usb.org/hid) makes it possible to access these
devices on desktop computers using operating system drivers. The web platform
supports HIDs by relying on these drivers.

The inability to access uncommon HID devices is particularly painful when it
comes to gamepad support. Gamepads designed for PC often use HID for gamepad
inputs (buttons, joysticks, triggers) and outputs (LEDs, rumble). However,
gamepad inputs and outputs are not well standardized and web browsers often
require custom logic for specific devices. This is unsustainable and results in
poor support for the long tail of older and uncommon devices. It also causes the
browser to depend on quirks present in the behavior of specific devices.

## Demos, demos, demos {: #demos }

One of my team members is currently working on a how-to article. Since WebHID is
starting an origin trial in Chrome 86, some of us wanted to give you a heads up
and share a few demos to play with. If you're curious about how any of these
samples work, the source code for all of them is available on GitHub. [There's a
barebones code example][example] in the explainer.

To use the demos, enable the `#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` flag
in `chrome://flags`.

### MacBook Pro keyboard backlight

The biggest barrier to trying out any of these demos is lack of access to the
device. Fortunately, if you have a MacBook Pro with a TouchBar, you don't need
to buy anything. This demo lets you use the API right from your laptop. It also
shows how WebHID can be used to unlock functionality of built-in devices, not
just peripherals.

## Game controllers

Next up is something fewer of you are likely to have. Sony's DualShock 4 is a
wireless controller for PlayStation 4 game consoles.

The DualShock 4 Demo uses WebHID to receive the raw input reports from the
DualShock 4 and provides a high-level API to access the controller's gyroscope,
accelerometer, touchpad, button, and thumbstick inputs. It also supports rumble
and setting the color of an RGB LED housed within the controller.

### The BlinkStick Strip

BlinkStick Strip is a HID-compliant light strip with 8 RGB LEDs. The demo allows
the user to select from several blink patterns including chase, blink, and
Larson scanner (aka Cylon).

### Blink, blink, blink

What does this demo do? (Wait for it.) It blinks. Actually it's three demos that
use the blink(1) USB notification light.

blink(1) is simple and well-documented, which makes it a great option for
getting started with HID.

## Conclusion

I hope I've piqued your interest in the WebHID API. Watch this space in the
coming weeks for updates and for Part II of the introduction which will show you
how to use the API yourself.
