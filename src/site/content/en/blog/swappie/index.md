Swappie is a successful start-up that sells refurbished phones. For a few years
they prioritized adding new features over site performance, however when they
noticed that business results on the mobile site were lagging behind the desktop
version, a shift happened. They focused on optimizing performance and soon saw
an uptick in mobile revenue.

### Highlighting the opportunity

[Relative Mobile Conversion Rate](https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/mobile-challenge-and-how-measure-it/)
(Rel mCvR) is calculated by dividing the Mobile Conversion Rate with the Desktop
Conversion Rate. There are many opportunities for tracking speed metrics, but
connecting them to business metrics can be quite tricky. Since the same
campaigns and seasonalities reach both mobile and desktop, the Rel mCvR metric
strips away the influence of these external parameters, and only shows if the
mobile site is improving or not.

The
[average for the ten biggest e-commerce sites in the United States is a Rel mCvR of 50%](https://d34w0339mx0ifp.cloudfront.net/content/2020%20Ecommerce%20Stats%20Report.pdf),
but Swappie was at 24%. This indicated that the mobile site had challenges and
that the company was missing out on revenue, which led to launching the
performance improvement project.

### Measuring the impact of performance improvements

Swappie used Google Analytics to set up daily tracking of Rel mCvR and Mobile
Average Page Load Time, using
[this template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13BnREVWPhIiDYdEvOSYP3ovlMggPbnRQPMTSir6y__I/edit?usp=sharing).
(Read the
[instructions for how to use the spreadsheet](/value-of-speed/#doing-the-analysis).)
They also started
[tracking Core Web Vitals through Google Analytics and BigQuery](/vitals-ga4/).
With tracking in place, the developers started working on site performance.

After only three months of work, the impact was clearâ€“Rel mCvR went from 24% to
34% and mobile revenue had increased 42%!

### Optimizations

#### Optimizing for LCP and CLS

Swappie's development team found that there was lots of room for improvement of
small things that were overlooked for a long time. Studying the site on
different viewports, and in different languages, highlighted issues with LCP and
CLS that were easy to solve and had a big impact on overall performance.
For example, rendering the LCP element on the server instead of the client when
possible led to decreased LCP.

Detecting layout shifts was challenging, since they might vary a lot based on
the viewport and connection. After getting [CWV metrics from users to their
analytics](/vitals-ga4/), they knew they were on the right track
as CLS had decreased.

#### Images

Images were optimised with preloading, lazy loading and proper sizing. They
preload major images (for example LCP), while loading images outside of the
viewport only when needed.

#### Fonts

Swappie optimised fonts by switching providers. This made a big impact as they
needed an optimal way to handle typefaces required by different languages.

#### Third-party scripts

Swappie put a lot of effort into reviewing each third-party script and widget,
where it was used, and the functionalities it provided. After discussions with
all the stakeholders, they made plans to reduce the scripts' impact on the site,
while keeping the functionalities. They removed what was unnecessary and
optimized the rest, significantly decreasing the amount of third-party
JavaScript on the site.

#### Removing unused code and optimizing bundling

Optimising imports and removing unused JS and CSS contributed small improvements
to Swappie's site performance, however those small improvements add up over
time. They also optimised their bundling setup.

### Creating a performance culture at Swappie

The result Swappie achieved stems not only from the changes in the code, but
also the changes in the organization and its priorities.

The engineering lead, Teemu Huovinen, explains:

{% Blockquote 'Teemu Huovinen' %}
You need to link site speed to business metrics to truly highlight the
importance of it. It all comes down to prioritisation when you're short on time
and resources, which is always the case. Prioritising customer value is the way
to go, but it's all too easy to focus on new features and more direct conversion
improvements if you see site speed as only improving the "feel" of the site.
Linking site speed to business metrics is not always easy, and that's where the
[calculation with Rel mCvR](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13BnREVWPhIiDYdEvOSYP3ovlMggPbnRQPMTSir6y__I/edit?usp=sharing)
helped us a lot.
{% endBlockquote %}

Once the team of developers was given the opportunity to focus completely on
site speed for a quarter, they were more motivated to dive deeper.

{% Blockquote 'Teemu Huovinen' %}
Combining our impact with our team's growth is what makes it even more
impressive. Four of our seven developers had started within the month when we
began working on performance. All credit to the team, it's truly amazing how we
were able to rally around the topic and have such great impact.
{% endBlockquote %}

Teemu also points out the importance of spending time at the start to make
data-informed plans, learning how to use the DevTools Performance tab, and
setting up user analytics before making any improvements. Graphs (especially the
ones going in the right direction) are a great source of feedback and validation
for your work! Looking at user CWV metrics alongside Lighthouse scores helped
them focus on optimizing the right things that would affect the most people.
