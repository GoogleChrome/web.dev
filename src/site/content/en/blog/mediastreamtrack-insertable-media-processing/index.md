{% Aside %} Insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` is part of the
[capabilities project](https://web.dev/fugu-status/) and is currently in development. This post will
be updated as the implementation progresses. {% endAside %}

## Background

In the context of the
[Media Capture and Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API)
the [`MediaStreamTrack`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack)
interface represents a single media track within a stream; typically, these are audio or video
tracks, but other track types may exist.
[`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) objects consist of
zero or more `MediaStreamTrack` objects, representing various audio or video tracks. Each
`MediaStreamTrack` may have one or more channels. The channel represents the smallest unit of a
media stream, such as an audio signal associated with a given speaker, like left or right in a
stereo audio track.

## What is insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack`?

The core idea behind insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` is to expose the content of a
`MediaStreamTrack` as a collection of [streams](/streams/) (as defined by the WHATWG
[Streams API](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/)). These streams can be manipulated to introduce new
components.

Granting developers access to the video (or audio) stream directly allows them to apply
modifications directly to the stream. In contrast, realizing the same video manipulation task with
traditional methods requires developers to use intermediaries such as `<canvas>` elements. (For
details of this type of process, see, for example,
[video + canvas = magic](https://html5doctor.com/video-canvas-magic/).)

## Use cases

Use cases for insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` include, but are not limited to:

- Video conferencing gadgets like "funny hats" or virtual backgrounds.
- Voice processing like software [vocoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder).

## How to use insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack`

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

Starting in Chrome 90, insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` is available as part of the
WebCodecs origin trial in Chrome. The origin trial is expected to end in Chrome 91 (July 14, 2021).
If necessary, a separate origin trial will continue for insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack`.

{% include 'content/origin-trials.njk' %}

### Register for the origin trial {: #register-for-ot }

{% include 'content/origin-trial-register.njk' %}

### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` locally, without an origin trial token,
enable the `#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` flag in `chrome://flags`.

### Feature detection

You can feature-detect insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` support as follows.

```js
if ('MediaStreamTrackProcessor' in window && 'MediaStreamTrackGenerator' in window) {
  // Insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` is supported.
}
```

### Core concepts

Insertable streams for `MediaStreamTrack` builds on concepts previously proposed by
[WebCodecs](https://web.dev/webcodecs/) and conceptually splits the `MediaStreamTrack` into two
components:

- The `MediaStreamTrackProcessor`, which consumes a `MediaStreamTrack` object's source and generates
  a stream of media frames, specifically
  [`VideoFrame`](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/#videoframe-interface) or
  [`AudioFrame`](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/#audioframe-interface)) objects. You can think of
  this as a track sink that is capable of exposing the unencoded frames from the track as a
  `ReadableStream`. It also exposes a control channel for signals going in the opposite direction.
- The `MediaStreamTrackGenerator`, which consumes a stream of media frames and exposes a
  `MediaStreamTrack` interface. It can be provided to any sink, just like a track from
  `getUserMedia()`. It takes media frames as input. In addition, it provides access to control
  signals that are generated by the sink.

#### The `MediaStreamTrackProcessor`

A `MediaStreamTrackProcessor` object exposes two properties:

- `readable`: Allows reading the frames from the `MediaStreamTrack`. If the track is a video track,
  chunks read from `readable` will be `VideoFrame` objects. If the track is an audio track, chunks
  read from `readable` will be `AudioFrame` objects.
- `writableControl`: Allows sending control signals to the track. Control signals are objects of
  type `MediaStreamTrackSignal`.

#### The `MediaStreamTrackGenerator`

A `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` object likewise exposes two properties:

- `writable`: A `WritableStream` that allows writing media frames to the
  `MediaStreamTrackGenerator`, which is itself a `MediaStreamTrack`. If the `kind` attribute is
  `"audio"`, the stream accepts `AudioFrame` objects and fails with any other type. If kind is
  `"video"`, the stream accepts `VideoFrame` objects and fails with any other type. When a frame is
  written to `writable`, the frame's `close()` method is automatically invoked, so that its media
  resources are no longer accessible from JavaScript.
- `readableControl`: A `ReadableStream` that allows reading control signals sent from any sinks
  connected to the `MediaStreamTrackGenerator`. Control signals are objects of type
  `MediaStreamTrackSignal`.

In the `MediaStream` model, apart from media, which flows from sources to sinks, there are also
control signals that flow in the opposite direction (i.e., from sinks to sources via the track). A
`MediaStreamTrackProcessor` is a sink and it allows sending control signals to its track and source
via its `writableControl` property. A `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` is a track for which a custom
source can be implemented by writing media frames to its `writable` field. Such a source can receive
control signals sent by sinks via its `readableControl` property.

### Bringing it all together

The core idea is to create a processing chain as follows:

Platform Track → Processor → Transform → Generator → Platform Sinks

For a barcode scanner application, this chain would look as in the code sample below.

```js
const stream = await getUserMedia({ video: true });
const videoTrack = stream.getVideoTracks()[0];

const trackProcessor = new MediaStreamTrackProcessor({ track: videoTrack });
const trackGenerator = new MediaStreamTrackGenerator({ kind: 'video' });

const transformer = new TransformStream({
  async transform(videoFrame, controller) {
    const barcodes = await detectBarcodes(videoFrame);
    const newFrame = highlightBarcodes(videoFrame, barcodes);
    videoFrame.close();
    controller.enqueue(newFrame);
  },
});

trackProcessor.readable.pipeThrough(transformer).pipeTo(trackGenerator.writable);

trackGenerator.readableControl.pipeTo(trackProcessor.writableControl);
```

{% Aside %} This article barely scratches the surface of what is possible and going into the details
is way beyond the scope of this publication. For more examples, see the extended
[video processing demo](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/insertable-streams/video-processing/)
and the
[audio processing demo](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/insertable-streams/audio-processing/)
respectively. You can find the source code for both demos
[on GitHub](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/tree/gh-pages/src/content/insertable-streams).

## Demo

You can see the [QR code scanner demo](https://mediastreamtrack.glitch.me/) from the section above
in action on a desktop or mobile browser. Hold a QR code in front of the camera and the app will
detect it and highlight it. You can see the application's source code
[on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mediastreamtrack?path=index.html%3A21%3A50).

## Security and Privacy considerations

The security of this API relies on existing mechanisms in the web platform. As data is exposed using
the `VideoFrame` and `AudioFrame` interfaces, the rules of those interfaces to deal with
origin-tainted data apply. For example, data from cross-origin resources cannot be accessed due to
existing restrictions on accessing such resources (e.g., it is not possible to access the pixels of
a cross-origin image or video element). In addition, access to media data from cameras, microphones,
or screens is subject to user authorization. The media data this API exposes is already available
through other APIs. In addition to the media data, this API exposes some control signals such as
requests for new frames. These signals are intended as hints and do not pose a significant security
risk.
