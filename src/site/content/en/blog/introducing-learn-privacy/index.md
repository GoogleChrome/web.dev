Today we are excited to announce the latest in our series of courses on web.dev. [Learn Privacy](/learn/privacy/) is a brand new course written by [Stuart Langridge](https://twitter.com/sil).

When you acquire a new user, you are granted their trust. It's your organization's responsibility to honor this trust by keeping
user data private. And, as a developer, you have a key role to play. This course will help you to understand the ways in which you can help to protect the privacy of your users, with code snippets, best practices, and questions to ask yourself and your team on your privacy journey.

Learn Privacy joins our existing courses:

- [Learn CSS](/learn/css/)
- [Learn HTML](/learn/html/)
- [Learn Accessibility](/learn/accessibility)
- [Learn Images](/learn/images/)
- [Learn Responsive Design](/learn/design/)
- [Learn Forms](/learn/forms/)
- [Learn PWA](/learn/pwa/)


Watch this space for more opportunities to learn key web development skills, coming up very soon!
