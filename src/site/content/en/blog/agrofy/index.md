[Agrofy](https://www.agrofy.com.ar/) is an online marketplace for Latin
America's agribusiness market. They match up buyers and sellers of farm
machines, land, equipment, and financial services. In Q3 2020 a 4-person
development team at Agrofy spent a month optimizing their website because they
hypothesized that improved performance would lead to reduced bounce rates. They
specifically focused on improving [LCP](https://web.dev/lcp/), which is one of
the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals). These
performance optimizations led to a 70% improvement in LCP, which correlated to a
76% reduction in load abandonment (from 3.8% to 0.9%).

## Problem

While studying their business metrics, a development team at Agrofy noticed 
that their bounce rates seemed higher than industry benchmarks. Technical 
debt was also increasing in the website codebase.

## Solution

The Agrofy team pitched their executives and got buy-in to:

+   Migrate from an older, deprecated framework to a newer, actively
    supported one.
+   Optimize the load performance of the new codebase.

The migration took 2 months. Aside from the 4-person development team mentioned
earlier, this migration also involved product and UX specialists and a software
architect.  
The optimization project took the 4-person development team 1 month. They
focused on LCP, [CLS](https://web.dev/cls/) (another Core Web Vitals metric),
and [FCP](https://web.dev/fcp/). Specific optimizations included:

+   Lazy loading all non-visible elements with the
    [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
+   Delivering static resources faster with a [content delivery
    network](https://web.dev/content-delivery-networks/).
+   [Lazy loading images](https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/)
    with `loading="lazy"`.
+   [Server-side rendering](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web)
    of
    [critical rendering path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path)
    content.
+   [Preloading and preconnecting](https://web.dev/fast/#optimize-your-resource-delivery)
    critical resources to minimize handshake times.
+   Using real user monitoring (RUM) tools to identify which product detail
    pages were experiencing lots of layout shifts and then make adjustments to
    the codebase's architecture.

for more technical details.  

After enabling the new codebase on 20% of traffic, they launched the new site to
all visitors in early September 2020.

## Results

The development team's optimizations led to measurable improvements in many
different metrics:

+   LCP improved 70%.
+   CLS improved 72%.
+   Blocking JS requests reduced 100% and blocking CSS requests 80%.
+   [Long tasks](https://web.dev/long-tasks-devtools/) reduced 72%.
+   [First CPU Idle](https://web.dev/first-cpu-idle/) improved 25%.

Over the same time frame, real user monitoring data (also known as [field
data](https://web.dev/how-to-measure-speed/#lab-data-vs-field-data)) showed that
the load abandonment rate on product detail pages dropped 76%, from 3.8% to
0.9%:
