`Origin-Agent-Cluster` is a new HTTP response header that instructs the browser to prevent
synchronous scripting access between same-site cross-origin pages. Browsers may also use
`Origin-Agent-Cluster` as a hint that your origin should get its own, separate resources, such as a
dedicated process.

## Browser compatibility

Currently the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header is only implemented in Chrome 88 onward. It was designed
in close collaboration with representatives from Mozilla Firefox who have marked it as [worth
prototyping](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/#domenic-origin-isolation), and has [a
preliminary positive
reception](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2020-August/031355.html) from
representatives of WebKit, the browser engine used by Safari.

But in the meantime, there's no problem with deploying the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header to all your
users today. Browsers which don't understand it will just ignore it. And, since pages in
origin-keyed agent clusters can actually do [fewer things](#limitations) than site-keyed ones (the
default), there's no interoperability issue to be worried about.

## Why browsers can't automatically segregate same-site origins

The web is built on the [same-origin policy](/same-origin-policy/), which is a security feature that
restricts how documents and scripts can interact with resources from another
[origin](/same-site-same-origin/#origin). For example, a page hosted at `https://a.example` is at a
different origin from one at `https://b.example`, or one at `https://sub.a.example`.

Behind the scenes, browsers use the separation that origins provide in different ways. In the old
days, even though separate origins would not be able to access each other's data, they would still
share resources like operating system threads, processes, and memory allocation. This meant that if
one tab was slow, it would slow down all the other tabs. Or if one tab used too much memory, it
would crash the entire browser.

These days browsers are more sophisticated, and try to separate different origins into different
processes. How exactly this works varies per browser: most browsers have some level of separation
between tabs, but different iframes inside a single tab might share a process. And because processes
come with some memory overhead, they use heuristics to avoid spawning too many: for example, Firefox
has a [user-configurable process limit](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/performance-settings),
and Chrome varies its behavior between desktop (where memory is more plentiful) and mobile (where it
is scarce).

These heuristics are not perfect. And they suffer from an important limitation: because there are
exceptions to the same-origin policy which allow subdomains like `https://sub.a.example` and
`https://a.example` to talk to each other, browsers cannot automatically segregate subdomains from
each other.

{% Aside %}
The technical distinction here is that the browser cannot automatically segregate pages which are
same-site to each other, even if they are cross-origin. The most common cases of same-site
cross-origin pages happen with subdomains, but see the article [Understanding "same-site" and
"same-origin"](/same-site-same-origin/) for more.
{% endAside %}

This default behavior is called "site-keyed agent clusters": that is, the browser groups pages based
on their _site_. The new `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header asks the browser to change this default
behavior for a given page, putting it into an _origin_-keyed agent cluster, so that it is grouped
only with other pages that have the exact same origin. In particular, same-site cross-origin pages
will be excluded from the agent cluster.

This opt-in separation allows browsers to give these new origin-keyed agent clusters their own
dedicated resources, which are not combined with those of other origins. For example, such pages
could get their own process, or be scheduled on separate threads. By adding the
`Origin-Agent-Cluster` header to your page, you're indicating to the browser that the page would
benefit from such dedicated resources.

However, in order to perform the separation, and get these benefits, the browser needs to disable
some legacy features.

## What origin-keyed pages cannot do {: #limitations }

When your page is in an origin-keyed agent cluster, you give up some abilities to talk to same-site
cross-origin pages that were previously available. In particular:

- You can no longer set
  [`document.domain`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/domain). This is a
  legacy feature that normally allows same-site cross-origin pages to synchronously access each
  other's DOM, but in origin-keyed agent clusters, it is disabled.

- You can no longer send
  [`WebAssembly.Module`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Module)
  objects to other same-site cross-origin pages via `postMessage()`.

- (Chrome-only) You can no longer send
  [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer)
  or
  [`WebAssembly.Memory`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Memory)
  objects to other same-site cross-origin pages.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Chrome is the only browser that allows sending `SharedArrayBuffer` and `WebAssembly.Memory` objects
to same-site cross-origin pages. Other browsers, and [future versions of
Chrome](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/1NKvbIj3dq4/m/Vgfisu5HAwAJ), will
prevent sending these objects across the origin boundary regardless of whether the agent cluster is
origin-keyed or site-keyed.
{% endAside %}

## When to use origin-keyed agent clusters

The origins that most benefit from the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header are those that:

- Perform best with their own dedicated resources when possible. Examples include
  performance-intensive games, video conferencing sites, or multimedia creation apps.

- Contains resource-intensive iframes that are different-origin, but same-site. For example, if
  `https://mail.example.com` embeds `https://chat.example.com` iframes, origin-keying
  `https://mail.example.com/` ensures that the code written by the chat team cannot accidentally
  interfere with code written by the mail team, and can hint to the browser to give them separate
  processes to schedule them independently and decrease their performance impact on each other.

- Expect to be embedded on different-origin, same-site pages, but know themselves to be
  resource-intensive. For example, if `https://customerservicewidget.example.com` expects to use
  lots of resources for video chat, and will be embedded on various origins throughout
  `https://*.example.com`, the team maintaining that widget could use the `Origin-Agent-Cluster`
  header to try to decrease their performance impact on embedders.

Additionally, you'll also need to make sure you're OK disabling the above-discussed [rarely-used
cross-origin communication features](#limitations), and that your site is [using
HTTPS](/why-https-matters/).

But in the end, these are just guidelines. Whether origin-keyed agent clusters will help your site
or not is ultimately best determined through measurements. In particular, you'll want to [measure
your Web Vitals](/vitals-measurement-getting-started/), and potentially your [memory
usage](/monitor-total-page-memory-usage/), to see what impact origin-keying has. (Memory usage in
particular is a potential concern, as increasing the number of processes in play can cause more
per-process memory overhead.) You shouldn't just roll out origin-keying and hope for the best.

### How is this related to cross-origin isolation? {: #cross-origin-isolation }

Origin-keying of agent clusters via the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header is related to, but separate
from, [cross-origin isolation](/coop-coep/) via the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers.

Any site which makes itself cross-origin isolated will also disable the same [same-site cross-origin
communications features](#limitations) as when using the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header. However, the
`Origin-Agent-Cluster` header can still be useful on top of cross-origin isolation, as an additional
hint to the browser to modify its resource allocation heuristics. So you should still consider
applying the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header, and measuring the results, even on pages that are
already cross-origin isolated.

## How to use the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header {: #how-to-use }

To use the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header, configure your web server to send the following HTTP
response header:

```http
Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1
```

The value of `?1` is the [structured
header](https://www.fastly.com/blog/improve-http-structured-headers) syntax for a boolean `true`
value.

It's important to send this header on _all_ responses from your origin, not just some pages.
Otherwise, you can get inconsistent results, where the browser "remembers" seeing an origin-keying
request and so it origin-keys even on pages that don't ask for it. Or the reverse: if the first page
a user visits doesn't have the header, then the browser will remember that your origin does not want
to be origin-keyed, and will ignore the header on subsequent pages.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Don't forget to send the header on error pages, like your 404 page!
{% endAside %}

{% Details %}
{% DetailsSummary %}
Why can't the browser always respect the header?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

The reason for this "memory" is to ensure consistency of keying for an origin. If some pages on an
origin were origin-keyed, while others weren't, then you could have two same-origin pages which were
put into different agent clusters, and thus weren't allowed to talk to each other. This would be
very strange, both for web developers and for the internals of the browser. So, the specification
for `Origin-Agent-Cluster` instead ignores the header if it's inconsistent with what it's previously
seen for a given origin. In Chrome, this will result in a console warning.

This consistency is scoped to a browsing context group, which is a group of tabs, windows, or
iframes which can all reach each other via mechanisms like `window.opener`, `frames[0]`, or
`window.parent`. This means that, once an origin's origin- or site-keying has been settled (by the
browser either seeing, or not seeing, the header), changing it requires opening up an entirely new
tab, not connected to the old one in any way.

These details can be important for testing the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header. When first adding it
to your site, just reloading the page will not work; you'll need to close the tab and open a new
one.
{% endDetails %}

To check whether the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header is applied, use the JavaScript
`window.originAgentCluster` property. This will be `true` in cases where the header (or other
mechanisms, like [cross-origin isolation](#cross-origin-isolation)) caused origin-keying; `false`
when it did not; and `undefined` in browsers that don't implement the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header.
Logging this data to your analytics platform can provide a valuable check that you've configured
your server correctly.

Finally, note that the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header will only work on [secure
contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), i.e. on HTTPS
pages or on `http://localhost`. Non-localhost HTTP pages do _not_ support origin-keyed agent
clusters.

## Origin-keying is not a security feature

While using an origin-keyed agent cluster does isolate your origin from synchronous access from
same-site cross-origin pages, it does not give the [protection](https://web.dev/why-coop-coep/) of
security-related headers like
[`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cross-Origin_Resource_Policy_(CORP))
and
[`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy).
In particular, it is not a reliable protection against side channel attacks like
[Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)).

This might be a bit surprising, because origin-keying can sometimes cause your origin to get its own
process, and separate processes are an important defence against side-channel attacks. But remember
that the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header is only a hint in that regard. The browser is under no
obligation to give your origin a separate process, and it might not do so for a variety of reasons:

- A browser might not implement the technology to do so. For example, currently Safari and Firefox
  can put separate tabs into their own processes, but cannot yet do so for iframes.

- The browser might decide it's not worth the overhead of a separate process. For example, on
  low-memory Android devices, or in Android WebView, Chrome uses as few processes as possible.

- The browser might want to respect the request that the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header indicates,
  but it could do so using different isolation technology than processes. For example, Chrome is
  [exploring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12wEWJsZmxVnNwVGuxuEJF4922OWUr4fCs1xKHi9mTiI/edit?usp=sharing)
  using threads instead of processes for this sort of performance isolation.

- The user, or code running on a different site, might have already navigated to a site-keyed page
  on your origin, causing the [consistency guarantee](#how-to-use) to kick in and the
  `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header to be ignored entirely.

For these reasons, it's important not to think of origin-keyed agent clusters as a security feature.
Instead, it's a way of helping the browser prioritize resource allocation, by hinting that your
origin would benefit from dedicated resources (and that you're willing to give up [certain
features](#limitations) in exchange).
