Adding delightful animations to your website is not only for cosmetic reasons. When used correctly, animations improve user perception and [memory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229351931_The_Effects_of_Animation_and_Format_on_the_Perception_and_Memory_of_Online_Advertising) of your brand, guide user actions, but also helps users navigate your applicationâ€”providing context in a digital space.

The [Web Animations API](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/) has a long history. Original it was released Chrome 36, and the latest release (Chrome 84) brings us all the previously unsupported bits. This API enables developers to incorporate [imperative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNoqBAp8NI) animations with JavaScript. It was written to underlie both CSS animation and transition implementations and enable future effects to be developed, as well as existing effects to be composed and timed.

## Getting Started

To use the Web Animations API, we'll need to create a Keyframe Object. If you're familiar with CSS `@keyframe`s, this is very similar. What might look like [this](https://codepen.io/una/pen/RwWMvPw) in CSS:

```css
@keyframes openAnimation {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

Would look like [this](https://codepen.io/una/pen/abvYXJX) in JavaScript:

```js
const openAnimation = [
  { transform: 'scale(0)' }, 
  { transform: 'scale(1)' }, 
];
```

Where we set parameters for animation in CSS:

```css
.modal {
  animation: openAnimation 1s 1 ease-in;
}
```

We would set in JS:

```js
document.querySelector('.modal').animate(
    openAnimation ,  {
    duration: 1000, // 1s
    iterations: 1, // single iteration
    easing: 'ease-in' // easing function
  }
);
```

So the amount of code is about the same, but with JavaScript, we get a couple of superpowers that we don't have with CSS alone. A few of those are the ability to group effects, and to move within an animation timeline.

  Heiphenated property names become camel case when in keyframes (i.e. `background-color` to `backgroundColor`)

## Orchestrating Animations with Promises

In Chrome 84, we now have two methods that can be used with promises: `animation.ready()` and `animation.finished`

-  `animation.ready` is a promise that enables you to wait for pending changes to take effect (i.e. switching between playback control methods such as play and pause)
- `animation.finished` is a promise provides a means of executing custom JavaScript code when an animation is complete.

Let's continue with our previous example, and create an orchestrated animation chain with `animation.finished`. Here, we have a vertical transformation (`scaleY`), followed by a horizontal transformation (`scaleX`), followed by an opacity change on a child element: 

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src='./modal-open.gif' alt="applying transformations and opacity to an opening modal element">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    <a href="https://codepen.io/una/pen/dyYKJMz">See Demo on Codepen </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

-- CODE BLOCK HERE FROM THE ABOVE --

We've chained these animations using `animation.finished.then()` prior to executing the next animation set in the chain. This way, the animations appear in order, and we are even applying effects to different target elements with different options set (such as speed and ease).

Within CSS, this would be cumbersome to recreate. You'd have to use a `@keyframe` and sort out the correct percentages to place the animations, and use animation delays prior to triggering the animations in the sequence. Another factor is applying the animations to different elements (the parents vs the child, for example). This would need to be calculated properly with delays and there's a lot of room for error.

## Play, Pause, Reverse

What can open, should close! Luckily, since Chrome 39, the WAAPI has provided us the ability to play, pause, and reverse our animations.

We can take the above animation, and give it a smooth, reversed animation when clicking the button again using `.reverse()`. This way, we can create a smoother and more contextual interaction for our modal.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src='./modal-reverse.gif' alt="reverse modal, opening and closing">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    <a href="https://codepen.io/una/pen/eYpbaOb">See Demo on Codepen </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

What we need to do is create two play-pending animations, and then pause one of the animations, delaying it until the other is finished. We can then use promises to wait for each to be finished before playing. Finally, we can check to see if a flag (such as an `open` variable in this case) is set, and then reverse each animation.

```js
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Create two play-pending animations.
  const expandCollapseAnim = modal.animate(openModal, openModalSettings);
  const showFadeAnim = text.animate(fadeIn, fadeInSettings);
  
  // Pause one of the animations and delay it's start until the
  // other is finished.
  let firstAnimation, secondAnimation;
  if (open) {
    firstAnimation = showFadeAnim;
    secondAnimation = expandCollapseAnim;
    showFadeAnim.currentTime = fadeInSettings.duration;
    expandCollapseAnim.currentTime = openModalSettings.duration;
    expandCollapseAnim.reverse();
    showFadeAnim.reverse();
  } else {
    firstAnimation = expandCollapseAnim;
    secondAnimation = showFadeAnim;
  }
  secondAnimation.pause();
  
  firstAnimation.finished.then(() => {
    secondAnimation.play();
  });

  // set open state
  open = !open;
});
```

## Performance Improvements with Replaceable Animations

When creating animations based on events, such as on mousemose, a new animation is created each time, which can quickly consume memory and degrade performance.  To address this problem, replaceable animations were introduced, enabling finished animation effects to be overriden by other finished animations and removed from the set of active animations.

For a small number of animations, this is not typically a problem, but consider the following example:

-- have graphic here to match DEMO with mouse cursor trail --

There are a few new methods to take your animation control even  further:

- `animation.commitStyles` is a method used to update the style of an element based on underlying style along with all animatinos on the element in the composite order.
- `animation.onremove` - with the onremove event handler, we can run custom JavaScript code when an animation is replaced.
- `animation.replaceState` provides a means of tracking whether an animation is active, persisted or removed.
- `animation.persist` marks an animation as non-replaceable. Persisting an animation is useful when used with animation compositing modes, such as add.

Speaking of compositing modes, with the Web Animations API, you can now composite your animations, meaning they can be additive or accumulate.

## Partial Keyframes

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src='./retargetting-demo.gif' alt="retargetting demo">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    <a href="https://codepen.io/una/pen/BaoveQJ">See Demo on Codepen </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
 
```js
elem.addEventListener('mousemove', evt => {
  circle.animate(
    { transform: translate(${evt.clientX}px, ${evt.clientY}px) },
    { duration: 500, fill: 'forwards' }
  );
});
```

Example here shows retargetting. This highlights partial keyframes. 

- only a to keyframe, no from keyframe, the from from is implicit from where you are now

## Compositing Animations

[Composite modes](https://css-tricks.com/additive-animation-web-animations-api/) allow developers to write distinct animations and have control over how effects are combined. Three composite modes are now supported: `replace` (the default mode), `add`, and `accumulate`.

When you composite animations, a develoepr can write short, distinct effects and see them combined together:

-- example of dropdown w/a bounce w/ add --

-- show what that looks like w/o add and explain why its much more cumbersome --

-- accumulate -- 

A box animating without composite (default of replace) would look like this:

-- gif here showing the differences with the box demo --

If we added an `add` composite, the animation would look much different:

The composite mode `accumulate` behaves slightly differently from add. For properties that are additive such as translations or rotations, the results are the same.  Properties like scale behave differently.  


### What's Coming Next!

These are all exciting additions to the Web Animations capabilities in todays browsers. And even more capabilities are coming down the pipeline:

- Scroll-linked animations (Houdini API)
- Mutable timelines
