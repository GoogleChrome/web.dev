When used correctly, animations improve user perception and [memory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229351931_The_Effects_of_Animation_and_Format_on_the_Perception_and_Memory_of_Online_Advertising) of your brand, guide user actions, and help users navigate your applicationâ€”providing context in a digital space.

The [Web Animations API](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/) is a tool that enables developers to write [imperative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNoqBAp8NI) animations with JavaScript. It was written to underpin both CSS animation and transition implementations and enable future effects to be developed, as well as existing effects to be composed and timed.

While it has a long history, originally launching in Chrome 36, the latest release, Chrome 84, brings us a slew of previously unsupported features. 

## Getting started

Creating an animation via the web animations API should feel very familiar if you've used `"@keyframe"` rules. First you'll need to create a Keyframe Object. What might look like [this](https://codepen.io/una/pen/RwWMvPw) in CSS:

```css
@keyframes openAnimation {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

Would look like [this](https://codepen.io/una/pen/abvYXJX) in JavaScript:

```js
const openAnimation = [
  { transform: 'scale(0)' }, 
  { transform: 'scale(1)' }, 
];
```

Where you set parameters for animation in CSS:

```css
.modal {
  animation: openAnimation 1s 1 ease-in;
}
```

You would set in JS:

```js
document.querySelector('.modal').animate(
    openAnimation ,  {
    duration: 1000, // 1s
    iterations: 1, // single iteration
    easing: 'ease-in' // easing function
  }
);
```

The amount of code is about the same, but with JavaScript, you get a couple of superpowers that you don't have with CSS alone. This includes the ability to sequence effects, and to control their play states.

{% Aside %}
  Hyphenated property names become camel case when used in keyframes (i.e. `background-color` to `backgroundColor`)
{% endAside %}

## Orchestrating animations with promises

In Chrome 84, you now have two methods that can be used with promises: `"animation.ready"` and `"animation.finished"`.

- `animation.ready` enables you to wait for pending changes to take effect (i.e. switching between playback control methods such as play and pause).
- `animation.finished` provides a means of executing custom JavaScript code when an animation is complete.

Let's continue with our previous example, and create an orchestrated animation chain with `"animation.finished"`. Here, you have a vertical transformation (`"scaleY"`), followed by a horizontal transformation (`"scaleX"`), followed by an opacity change on a child element: 

<figure class="w-figure">
  <video controls autoplay loop muted class="w-screenshot">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/web-animations/modal-open.mp4">
  </video>
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

```js/1
const transformAnimation = modal.animate(openModal, openModalSettings);
transformAnimation.finished.then(() => { text.animate(fadeIn, fadeInSettings)});
```

We've chained these animations using `"animation.finished.then()"` prior to executing the next animation set in the chain. This way, the animations appear in order, and you are even applying effects to different target elements with different options set (such as speed and ease).

Within CSS, this would be cumbersome to recreate, especially when applying unique, yet sequenced animations to multiple elements. You'd have to use a `"@keyframe"`, sort out the correct timing percentages to place the animations, and use `"animation-delay"` prior to triggering the animations in the sequence.

## Play, pause, and reverse

What can open, should close! Luckily, since [Chrome 39](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/12/web-animation-playback), the WAAPI has provided us the ability to play, pause, and reverse our animations.

You can take the above animation, and give it a smooth, reversed animation when clicking the button again using `".reverse()"`. This way, you can create a smoother and more contextual interaction for our modal.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <video controls autoplay loop muted class="w-screenshot">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/web-animations/modal-reverse.mp4">
  </video>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

What you need to do is create two play-pending animations (`"openModal"`, and an inline opacity transformation), and then pause one of the animations, delaying it until the other is finished. You can then use promises to wait for each to be finished before playing. Finally, you can check to see if a flag (such as an "open" variable in this case) is set, and then reverse each animation.

```js/17-20
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', () => {                                 
  // Create two play-pending animations.
  let animations = [
    document.querySelector('.modal').animate(openModal, openModalSettings),
    document.querySelector('.text').animate({ opacity: [0, 1] }, openModalSettings)
  ];

  // Pause one of the animations and delay it until the other is finished.
  if (open) {
    animations.forEach((anim) => {
      anim.currentTime = anim.effect.getTiming().duration;
      anim.reverse();
    });
    animations = animations.reverse();
  }
  
  // Run animations sequentially.
  animations[1].pause();  
  animations[0].finished.then(() => {
    animations[1].play();
  });
  open = !open;
});
```

## Performance improvements with replaceable animations

When creating animations based on events, such as on `"mousemove"`, a new animation is created each time, which can quickly consume memory and degrade performance.  To address this problem, replaceable animations were introduced, enabling automated cleanup, where finished animations are flagged as replaceable and automatically removed if replaced by another finished animation. Consider the following example:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <video controls autoplay loop muted class="w-screenshot">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/web-animations/comet-trail.mp4">
  </video>
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
  A comet trail animates when the mouse moves. <a href="https://codepen.io/kevers-google/details/gOaqXoQ">View Demo on Codepen</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Each time the mouse moves, the browser re-calculates the position for each ball in the comet trail and creates an animation to this new point. The browser now knows to replace these animations instead of add new animations when:

1. The animation is finished
2. There is one or more animations higher in composite ordering that are also finished
3. The new animations are animating the same properties.

You can see exactly how many animations are being replaced by tallying up a counter with each removed animation, using `"anim.onremove"` to trigger the counter.

There are a few additional methods to take your animation control even further:

- `animation.commitStyles()` updates the style of an element based on the underlying style along with all animations on the element in the composite order.
- `animation.onremove()` calls some custom JavaScript code when an animation is replaced.
- `animation.replaceState()` provides a means of tracking whether an animation is active, persisted, or removed.
- `animation.persist()` marks an animation as non-replaceable. Persisting an animation is useful when used with animation compositing modes, such as "add".

## Dynamic interactions with partial keyframes

<figure class="w-figure">
<video controls autoplay loop muted class="w-screenshot">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/web-animations/retargetting.mp4">
  </video>  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Retargeting example, where a mouse click adjusts the animation to a new location. <a href="https://codepen.io/una/details/BaoveQJ">See Demo on Codepen </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
 
 ```js
elem.addEventListener('mousemove', evt => {
  rectangle.animate(
    { transform: translate(${evt.clientX}px, ${evt.clientY}px) },
    { duration: 500, fill: 'forwards' }
  );
});
```

In this example, there is no initial location from which to move. This is called a **partial keyframe**. Instead, the mouse click does a few things: it sets a new end location, triggers a new animation, and sets the a new initial location based. New animations can occur *during* existing animations, meaning that the current animation will be interrupted, a new start and end point set, and a new animation triggered.

## Smoother animations with composite modes

With the Web Animations API, you can now composite your animations, meaning they can be additive or accumulative. [Composite modes](https://css-tricks.com/additive-animation-web-animations-api/) allow developers to write distinct animations and have control over how effects are combined. Three composite modes are now supported: `"replace"` (the default mode), `"add"`, and `"accumulate"`.

When you composite animations, a developer can write short, distinct effects and see them combined together. In the example below, we are applying a rotation and scale keyframe to each box, with the only adjustment being the composite mode, added as an option:

<figure class="w-figure">
<video controls autoplay loop muted class="w-screenshot">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/web-animations/replace-add-accumulate.mp4">
  </video>  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    <a href="https://codepen.io/kevers-google/pen/wvKbaGM"> See Demo on Codepen </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In the default, `"replace"` composite mode, the final animation replaces the transform property and ends up at `rotate(360deg) scale(1.4)`. For `"add"`, composite adds the rotation and multiplies the scale, resulting in a final state of `rotate(720deg) scale(1.96)`. `"accumulate"` combines the transformations, resulting in `rotate(720deg) scale(1.8)`. For more on the intricasies of these composite modes, check out the [Web Animations Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#the-compositeoperation-enumeration).

Let's take a look at a UI element example:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <video controls autoplay loop muted class="w-screenshot">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-dev-assets/web-animations/dropdown.mp4">
  </video>
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
  A bouncy dropdown menu which has two composited animations applied to it. <a href="https://codepen.io/kevers-google/details/ExVrbEm">View Demo on Codepen</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Here, two `"top"` animations are composited. The first is a macro-animation, which moves the dropdown by the full height of the menu itself as a slide-in effect from the top of the page, and the second, a micro-animation, applies a little bounce as it hits the bottom. Using the `"add"` composite mode enables a smoother transition.

```js/12
const dropDown = menu.animate(
    [
      { top: `${-menuHeight}px`, easing: 'ease-in' },
      { top: 0 }
    ], { duration: 300, fill: 'forwards' });

  dropDown.finished.then(() => {
    const bounce = menu.animate(
      [
        { top: '0px', easing: 'ease-in' },
        { top: '10px', easing: 'ease-out' },
        { ... }
      ], { duration: 300, composite: 'add' });
  });
```
