Today we are excited to announce a new addition to our series of courses on
web.dev. [Learn Accessibility](/learn/accessibility/) is a brand new course
written by [Carie Fisher](https://twitter.com/cariefisher) that will take you
through the essentials for building accessible websites and web apps.

Seven modules are launching today, and the rest will follow in staged launches
through the end of 2022. 

Read them in whatever order you'd like, and we hope you'll discover some new
best practices. Even with our accessibility experts, we're constantly learning
about new tools and new techniques to make our sites the best they can be. Some
accessibility best practices differ, based on the disability you're addressing.
It's important to understand your users and to listen to people with
disabilities when they tell you what they need.

Learn Accessibility joins our existing courses:

* [Learn HTML](/learn/html/)
* [Learn CSS](/learn/css/)
* [Learn Responsive Design](/learn/design/)
* [Learn Forms](/learn/forms/)
* [Learn PWA](/learn/pwa/)

We are open to your feedback. [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/issues/new/choose)
and give as much information as you can so we can address your questions or
concerns.

Coming up, we'll also have a series of interviews with various people working in accessibility. Follow this space to read their insights.
