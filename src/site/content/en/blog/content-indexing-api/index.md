description: Your PWA might cache articles and media files, but how will your users know that your pages work while offline? The Content Indexing API is one answer to this question currently in an origin trial. Once the index is populated with content from your PWA, as well as any other installed PWAs, it will show up in dedicated areas of supported browsers.

## What is the Content Indexing API? {: #what }

Using a [progressive web
app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) means having access
to information people care about—images, videos, articles, and more—regardless
of the current state of your network connection. Technologies like [service
workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers),
the [Cache Storage
API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/cache-api),
and [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
provide you with the building blocks for storing and serving data when folks
interact directly with a PWA. But building a high-quality, offline-first PWA is
only part of the story. If folks don't realize that a web app's content is
available while they're offline, they won't take full advantage of the work you
put into implementing that functionality.

This is a **discovery** problem; how can your PWA make users aware of its
offline-capable content so that they can discover and view what's available? The
Content Indexing API is a solution to this problem. The developer-facing portion
of this solution is an extension to service workers, which allows developers to
add URLs and metadata of offline-capable pages to a local index maintained by
the browser. That enhancement is available in Chrome 84 and later.

Once the index is populated with content from your PWA, as well as any other
installed PWAs, it will be surfaced by the browser as shown below.

<div class="w-columns">
  <figure class="w-figure">
    <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled"
         src="downloads-menu.png"
         alt="A screenshot of the Downloads menu item on Chrome's new tab page.">
    <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
      First, select the <b>Downloads</b> menu item on Chrome's new tab page.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="w-figure">
    <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled"
         src="articles-for-you.png"
         alt="Media and articles that have been added to the index.">
    <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
      Media and articles that have been added to the index will be shown in the
      <b>Articles for You</b> section.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Additionally, Chrome can proactively recommend content when it detects that a
user is offline.

The Content Indexing API **is not an alternative way of caching content**. It's
a way of providing metadata about pages that are already cached by your service
worker, so that the browser can surface those pages when folks are likely to
want to view them. The Content Indexing API helps with **discoverability** of
cached pages.

{% Aside 'note' %}
  The Content Indexing API is not a searchable index. While you can get a list
  of all indexed entries, there's no way to query against indexed metadata
  directly.
{% endAside %}

## See it in action {: #see-it-in-action }

The best way to get a feel for the Content Indexing API is to try a sample
application.

1. Make sure that you're using a supported browser and platform. Currently,
   that's limited to **Chrome 84 or later on Android**. Go to `chrome://version` to see
   what version of Chrome you're running.
1. Visit [https://contentindex.dev](https://contentindex.dev)
1. Click the `+` button next to one or more of the items on the list.
1. (Optional) Disable your device's Wi-Fi and cellular data connection, or enable
   airplane mode to simulate taking your browser offline.
1. Choose **Downloads** from Chrome's menu, and switch to the **Articles for You** tab.
1. Browse through the content that you previously saved.

You can view [the source of the sample application on
GitHub](https://github.com/rayankans/contentindex.dev).

Another sample application, a [Scrapbook PWA](https://scrapbook-pwa.web.app/),
illustrates the use of the Content Indexing API with the [Web
Share Target API](/web-share-target/). The [code demonstrates a
technique](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/web-share/src/js/contentIndexing.js)
for keeping the Content Indexing API in sync with items stored by a web app
using the [Cache Storage API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/cache-api).

## Using the API {: #using-the-api }

To use the API your app must have a service worker and URLs that are navigable
offline. If your web app does not currently have a service worker, the [Workbox
libraries](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) can simplify
creating one.

### What type of URLs can be indexed as offline-capable? {: #offline-capable-urls }

The API supports indexing URLs corresponding to HTML documents. A URL for a cached
media file, for example, can't be indexed directly. Instead, you need to provide
a URL for a page that displays media, and which works offline.

A recommended pattern is to create a "viewer" HTML page that could accept the
underlying media URL as a query parameter and then display the contents of the
file, potentially with additional controls or content on the page.

Web apps can only add URLs to the content index that are under the
[scope](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker)
of the current service worker. In other words, a web app could not add a URL
belonging to a completely different domain into the content index.

### Overview {: #api-overview }

The Content Indexing API supports three operations: adding, listing, and
removing metadata. These methods are exposed from a new property, `index`, that
has been added to the
<code>[ServiceWorkerRegistration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration)</code>
interface.

The first step in indexing content is getting a reference to the current
[`ServiceWorkerRegistration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration). Using <code>[navigator.serviceWorker.ready](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/ready)</code> is the most straightforward way:

```js
const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;

// Remember to feature-detect before using the API:
if ('index' in registration) {
  // Your Content Indexing API code goes here!
}
```

If you're making calls to the Content Indexing API from within a service worker,
rather than inside a web page, you can refer to the `ServiceWorkerRegistration`
directly via `registration`. It will [already be
defined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/registration)
as part of the `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.`

### Adding to the index {: #adding-items }

Use the `add()` method to index URLs and their associated metadata. It's up to
you to choose when items are added to the index. You might want to add to the
index in response to an input, like clicking a "save offline" button. Or you
might add items automatically each time cached data is updated via a mechanism
like [periodic background
sync](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/08/periodic-background-sync).

```js
await registration.index.add({
  // Required; set to something unique within your web app.
  id: 'article-123',

  // Required; url needs to be an offline-capable HTML page.
  // For compatibility during the Origin Trial, include launchUrl as well.
  url: '/articles/123',
  launchUrl: '/articles/123',

  // Required; used in user-visible lists of content.
  title: 'Article title',

  // Required; used in user-visible lists of content.
  description: 'Amazing article about things!',

  // Required; used in user-visible lists of content.
  icons: [{
    src: '/img/article-123.png',
    sizes: '64x64',
    type: 'image/png',
  }],

  // Optional; valid categories are currently:
  // 'homepage', 'article', 'video', 'audio', or '' (default).
  category: 'article',
});
```

Adding an entry only affects the content index; it does not add anything to the
[cache](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/cache-api).

#### Edge case: Call `add()` from `window` context if your icons rely on a `fetch` handler

When you call `add()`, Chrome will make a request for
each icon's URL to ensure that it has a copy of the icon to use when
displaying a list of indexed content.

* If you call `add()` from the `window` context (in other words, from your web
  page), this request will trigger a `fetch` event on your service worker.

* If you call `add()` within your service worker (perhaps inside another event
  handler), the request will **not** trigger the service worker's `fetch` handler.
  The icons will be fetched directly, without any service worker involvement. Keep
  this in mind if your icons rely on your `fetch` handler, perhaps because they
  only exist in the local cache and not on the network. If they do, make sure that
  you only call `add()` from the `window` context.

### Listing the index's contents {: #listing-items }

The `getAll()` method returns a promise for an iterable list of indexed entries
and their metadata. Returned entries will contain all of the data saved with
`add()`.

```js
const entries = await registration.index.getAll();
for (const entry of entries) {
  // entry.id, entry.launchUrl, etc. are all exposed.
}
```

### Removing items from the index {: #removing-items }

To remove an item from the index, call `delete()` with the `id` of the item to
remove:

```js
await registration.index.delete('article-123');
```

Calling `delete()` only affects the index. It does not delete anything from the
[cache](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/cache-api).

{% Aside 'warning' %}
  Once indexed, entries do not automatically expire. It's
  up to you to either present an interface in your web app for clearing out
  entries, or periodically remove older entries that you know should no longer be
  available offline.
{% endAside %}

### Handling a user delete event {: #handling-contentdelete }

When the browser displays the indexed content, it may include its own user
interface with a **Delete** menu item, giving people a chance to indicate that
they're done viewing previously indexed content. This is how the deletion
interface looks in Chrome 80:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="delete-menu.png" alt="The delete menu item." width="550">
</figure>

When someone selects that menu item, your web app's service worker will receive
a `contentdelete` event. While handling this event is optional, it provides a
chance for your service worker to "clean up" content, like locally cached media
files, that someone has indicated they are done with.

You do not need to call `registration.index.delete()` inside your
`contentdelete` handler; if the event has been fired, the relevant index
deletion has already been performed by the browser.

```js
self.addEventListener('contentdelete', (event) => {
  // event.id will correspond to the id value used
  // when the indexed content was added.
  // Use that value to determine what content, if any,
  // to delete from wherever your app stores it—usually
  // the Cache Storage API or perhaps IndexedDB.
});
```

{% Aside 'note' %}
  The `contentdelete` event is only fired when the deletion happens due to
  interaction with the browser's built-in user interface. It is _not_ fired when
  `registration.index.delete()` is called. If your web app triggers the index
  deletion using that API method, it should also [clean up cached
  content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/delete) at the
  same time.
{% endAside %}
