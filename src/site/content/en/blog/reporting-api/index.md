{% Banner 'caution', 'body' %} This is an API guide with detailed usage examples for the **Reporting
API (v1)**, which uses the `Reporting-Endpoints` header. If you're already using the legacy
Reporting API (`Report-To` header), head over to the [migration post](/reporting-api-migration)
instead. {% endBanner %}

Some errors only occur in production. You won't see them locally or during development because
**real users**, **real networks**, and **real devices** change the game. The Reporting API helps
catch some of these errors⏤such as security violations or deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API
calls⏤across your site, and transmits them to an endpoint you've specified. It lets you declare what
you'd like to monitor via HTTP headers, and is operated **by the browser**.

Setting up the Reporting API gives you peace of mind that when users experience these types of
errors, you'll know, so you can fix them. ✨

This post covers what this API can do and how to use it. Let's dive in!

## Demo and code

{% Aside 'codelab' %}
See the Reporting API in action starting from **[Chrome 96](https://chromestatus.com/features/schedule)** and newer (Chrome Beta or Canary, as of October 2021):

- [Demo site: reporting endpoint](https://reports-endpoint.glitch.me). This page receives and
  displays reports. See the [code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/reports-endpoint).
- [Demo site: report generation page](https://reporting-api-demo.glitch.me). This page uses the new
  Reporting API with the `Reporting-Endpoints` header. It also intentionally violates its own policies, uses deprecated APIs, and does other bad things in order to generate reports. `Reporting-Endpoints` on this page is set to send reports to the demo reporting endpoint mentioned above. See the
  [code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/reporting-api-demo).

{% endAside %}

## Overview

<figure>
{% Img src="image/O2RNUyVSLubjvENAT3e7JSdqSOx1/RgiT3KRy6w99wG1cAhha.png", alt="Diagram summarizing the steps below, from report generation to report access by the developer", width="800", height="240" %}
  <figcaption>
    How reports are generated and sent.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Let's assume that your site, `site.example`, has a Content-Security-Policy and a Document-Policy
(you don't need to know what these do in order to understand this example!).

You decide to monitor your site in order to know when these policies are violated, but also because
you want to keep an eye on deprecated or soon-to-be-deprecated APIs your codebase may be using.

To do so, you configure a `Reporting-Endpoints` header, and map these endpoint names via the
`report-to` directive in your policies where needed.

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main", default="https://reports.example/default"
```

```http
# Content-Security-Policy violations and Document-Policy violations will be sent to main-endpoint
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; report-to main-endpoint;
Document-Policy: document-write=?0; report-to=main-endpoint;
# Deprecation reports don't need an explicit endpoint because these reports are always sent to the `default` endpoint
```

Something unforeseen happens, and these policies get violated for some of your users.

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary 'h4' %}

Example violations

{% endDetailsSummary %}

`index.html`

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
<!-- CSP VIOLATION: Try to load a script that's forbidden as per the Content-Security-Policy -->
<script src="https://example.com/script.js"></script>
```

`script.js`, loaded by `index.html`

```javascript
// DOCUMENT-POLICY VIOLATION: Attempt to use document.write despite the document policy
try {
  document.write('<h1>hi</h1>');
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
// DEPRECATION: Call a deprecated API
const webkitStorageInfo = window.webkitStorageInfo;
```

{% endDetails %}

The browser generates a CSP violation report, a Document-Policy violation report, and a Deprecation
report that capture these issues.

With a short delay—up to a minute—the browser then sends the reports to the endpoint that was
configured for this violation type. The reports are sent
**[out-of-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_data)** by the browser itself (not by your
server nor by your site).

The endpoint(s) receive(s) these reports.

You can now access the reports on these endpoints and monitor what went wrong. You're ready to start
troubleshooting the problem that's affecting your users.

{% endDetails %}

## Use cases and report types

The Reporting API can be configured to help you monitor many types of interesting warnings or issues
that happen throughout your site:

{% Banner 'caution', 'body' %}

[Network Error Logging](https://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/) isn't listed because it isn't
supported in the new version of the API. Check the [migration
guide](/reporting-api-migration/#network-error-logging) for details.

has a permission policy that prevents microphone usage, and a script requests audio input.

{% endAside %}

## Reports

### What do reports look like? {: #report-format}

The browser sends reports to the endpoint you've configured. It sends requests that look as follows:

```http
POST
Content-Type: application/reports+json
```

The payload of these requests is a list of reports.

{% DetailsSummary 'h4' %}

Example list of reports

        <td>The <code>User-Agent</code> header of the request from which the report was generated.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

#### Credentialed reports

Reporting endpoints that have the [same origin](/same-site-same-origin/#same-origin-and-cross-origin) as the page that generates the report receive the credentials
(cookies) in the requests that contain the reports.

Credentials may give useful additional context about the report; for
example, whether a given user’s account is triggering errors consistently, or if a certain sequence
of actions taken on other pages is triggering a report on this page.

{% Aside %}[Cross-origin](/same-site-same-origin/#same-origin-and-cross-origin) endpoints don't receive
credentials. This is a security measure and can't be changed. {% endAside %}

### When and how does the browser send reports? {: #report-timing}

**Reports are delivered out-of-band from your site**: the browser controls when they're sent to the
configured endpoint(s). There's
also no way to control when the browser sends reports; it captures, queues, and sends them automatically at a suitable time.

This means that there's little to no performance concern when using the Reporting API.

**Reports are sent with a delay**⏤up to a minute⏤to increase the chances to send reports in batches.
This saves bandwidth to be respectful to the user's network connection, which is especially
important on mobile. The browser can also delay delivery if it's busy processing higher priority
work, or if the user is on a slow and/or congested network at the time.

{% Aside %} When you're debugging locally, you can turn off this delay for convenience. [See how](#save-time). {% endAside %}

### Third-party and first-party issues

Reports that are generated due to violations or deprecations happening **on your page** will be sent
to the endpoint(s) you've configured. This includes violations committed by **third-party scripts**
running on your page.

Violations or deprecations that happened **in a cross-origin iframe embedded in your page** will
**not** be reported to your endpoint(s) (at least not by default). An iframe could set up its own
reporting and even report to your site's⏤that is, the first-party's⏤reporting service; but that's up
to the framed site. Also note that most reports are generated only if a page's policy is violated,
and that your page's policies and the iframe's policies are different.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}

In Chrome DevTools, you'll see a console error or warning pop up for violations that are committed
by third-party scripts _and_ cross-origin iframes. Not all of these will translate into reports being
sent to your endpoint: the formers will, the latters won't.

{% endAside %}

#### Example with deprecations

</figure>

## Browser support

The table below sums up browser support for the **Reporting API v1**, that is with the
`Reporting-Endpoints` header. Browser support for the Reporting API v0 (`Report-To` header) is the
same, except for one report type: Network Error Logging isn't supported in the new Reporting API.
Read the [migration guide](/reporting-api-migration/#network-error-logging) for details.

    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Report type</th>

        <td>✘ No</td>
        <td>✔ Yes</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

{% Aside 'caution' %}

Browser support for CSP reporting is different from other reporting types, because CSP has been around for some time. CSP reports can be generated via:

- The legacy `report-uri` directive that doesn't rely on the Reporting API.
- The newer `report-to` directive that relies on the Reporting API (and the `Reporting-To` or the newer `Reporting-Endpoints` headers).

This table only summarizes support for `report-to` with the new `Reporting-Endpoints` header. Read the [CSP reporting migration tips](/reporting-api-migration/#csp-reporting-migration) if you're looking to migrate to `Reporting-Endpoints`.

{% endAside %}

## Using the Reporting API

### Decide where reports should be sent

You have two options:

- Send reports to an existing report collector service.
- Send reports to a reporting collector you build and operate yourself.

#### Option 1: Use an existing report collector service

Some examples of report collector services are:

- [report-uri](https://report-uri.com)
- [uriports](https://uriports.com)

If you know of other solutions, [open an
issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/issues) to let us know, and we'll update this post!

**Beside pricing, consider the following points when selecting a report collector:** 🧐

- Does this collector support all report types? For example, not all reporting endpoint solutions
  support COOP/COEP reports.
- Are you comfortable sharing any of your application's URLs with a third-party report collector?
  Even if the browser strips sensitive information from these URLs, sensitive information [may get
  leaked this way](https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#capability-urls). If this sounds too risky for
  your application, operate your own reporting endpoint.

#### Option 2: Build and operate your own report collector

Building your own server that receives reports isn't that trivial. To get started, you can fork our
lightweight boilerplate. It's built with Express and can receive and display reports.

{% Aside 'caution' %} Don't use it as-in in production, but feel free to use it for a quick
prototype. Make sure to fork it before using it, so that nobody you don't trust gets to see reports
generated by your page. {% endAside %}

1. Head over to the [boilerplate report collector](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/reports-endpoint).

{% Instruction 'remix' %}

3. You now have your clone! You can customize it for your own purposes.

If you're not using the boilerplate and are building your own server from scratch:

- Check for `POST` requests with a `Content-Type` of `application/reports+json` to recognize reports
  requests sent by the browser to your endpoint.
- If your endpoint lives on a different origin than your site, ensure it supports [CORS preflight
  requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request).

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} Make sure your endpoint supports [CORS preflight
requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request). {% endAside %}

#### Option 3: Combine Option 1 and 2

You may want to let a specific provider take care of some types of reports, but have an in-house
solution for others.

In this case, set multiple endpoints as follows:

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: endpoint-1="https://reports-collector.example", endpoint-2="https://my-custom-endpoint.example"
```

### Configure the `Reporting-Endpoints` header

Set a `Reporting-Endpoints` response header. Its value must be one or a series of comma-separated
key-value pairs:

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main", default="https://reports.example/default"
```

If you're migrating from the legacy Reporting API to the new Reporting API, it may make sense to
set **both** `Reporting-Endpoints` and `Report-To`. See details in the [migration
guide](/reporting-api-migration/#migration-steps). In particular, if you're using reporting for
`Content-Security-Policy` violations via the `report-uri` directive only, check the [migration
steps for CSP reporting](/reporting-api-migration/#migration-steps-for-csp-reporting).

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main", default="https://reports.example/default"
Report-To: ...
```

#### Keys (endpoint names)

Each key can be a name of your choice, such as `main-endpoint` or `endpoint-1`. You can decide to
set different named endpoints for different report types⏤for example, `my-coop-endpoint`,
`my-csp-endpoint`. With this, you can route reports to different endpoints depending on their
type.

If you want to receive **intervention**, **deprecation** and/or **crash** reports, set an endpoint
named `default`.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}

If the `Reporting-Endpoints` header defines no `default` endpoint, reports of this type will **not**
be sent (although they will be generated).

Despite its name, `default` is **not** a fallback endpoint. For example, if you set up `report-to my-endpoint` for `Document-Policy` and omit to define `my-endpoint` in `Reporting-Endpoints`,
`Document-Policy` violations reports will be generated but will **not** be sent because the browser doesn't know where to send them to.

{% endAside %}

#### Values (URLs)

Each value is a URL of your choice, where the reports will be sent to; the URL to set here depends
on what you've decided in Step 1.

An endpoint URL:

- Must start with a slash (`/`). Relative paths are **not** supported.
- Can be cross-origin; but in that case [credentials are not sent with the reports](#credentialed-reports).

#### Examples

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: my-coop-endpoint="https://reports.example/coop", my-csp-endpoint="https://reports.example/csp", default="https://reports.example/default"
```

You can then use each named endpoint in the appropriate policy, or use one single endpoint across all policies.

#### Where to set the header?

In the new Reporting API⏤the one that is covered in this post⏤ reports are scoped to **documents**.
This means that for one given origin, different documents, such as `site.example/page1` and
`site.example/page2`, can send reports to different endpoints.

To receive report for violations or deprecations take place on any page of your site, set the header as a middleware on all responses.
Here's an example in Express:

```javascript
const REPORTING_ENDPOINT_BASE = 'https://report.example';
const REPORTING_ENDPOINT_MAIN = `${REPORTING_ENDPOINT_BASE}/main`;
const REPORTING_ENDPOINT_DEFAULT = `${REPORTING_ENDPOINT_BASE}/default`;

app.use(function (request, response, next) {
  // Set up the Reporting API
  response.set(
    'Reporting-Endpoints',
    `main-endpoint="${REPORTING_ENDPOINT_MAIN}", default="${REPORTING_ENDPOINT_DEFAULT}"`,
  );
  next();
});
```

{% Aside %} This is different from the legacy Reporting API (`Report-To` header), where you could
set an "ambient" endpoint for one page, and automatically get reports for any page on the same
origin. If you're migrating from the legacy Reporting API to the new Reporting API, check the
[migration guide](/reporting-api-migration). {% endAside %}

### Edit your policies

Now that the `Reporting-Endpoints` header is configured, add a `report-to` directive to each policy
header for which you wish to receive violation reports. The value of `report-to` should be one of
the named endpoints you've configured.

You can use the multiple endpoint for multiple policies, or use different endpoints across policies.

{% Img src="image/O2RNUyVSLubjvENAT3e7JSdqSOx1/rqqhNNcLiTfrXXjiEHDU.png", alt="Diagram showing that
for each policy, the value of report-to should be one of the named endpoints you've configured.",
width="800", height="271" %}

`report-to` is not needed for **deprecation**, **intervention** and **crash** reports. These reports
aren't bound to any policy. They're generated as long as a `default` endpoint is set up and are sent
to this `default` endpoint.

#### Example

```http
# Content-Security-Policy violations and Document-Policy violations will be sent to main-endpoint
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; report-to main-endpoint;
Document-Policy: document-write=?0;report-to=main-endpoint;
# Deprecation reports don't need an explicit endpoint because these reports are always sent to the default endpoint
```

{% Banner 'warning', 'body' %} Getting the `report-to` syntax right can be tricky, because not all policies use
the same header structure. Depending on the policy, the right syntax may be
`report-to=main-endpoint` or `report-to main-endpoint`. Head over to the
[demo](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/reporting-api-demo?path=server.js%3A1%3A0) for code examples. {%
endBanner %}

### Example code

To see all this in context, below is an example Node server that uses Express and brings together
all the pieces discussed in this article. It shows how to configure reporting for several different
report types and displays the results.

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/reporting-api-demo?path=server.js&previewSize=0"

    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

## Debug your reporting setup

### Intentionally generate reports

When setting up the Reporting API, you'll likely need to intentionally violate your policies in order to check if reports are generated and sent as expected.
To
see example code that violates policies and does other bad things that will generate reports of all
types, check out the [demo](#demo-and-code).

### Save time

Reports may be sent with a delay⏤about a minute, which is a _long_ time when debugging. 😴 Luckily,
when debugging in Chrome, you can use the flag `--short-reporting-delay` to receive reports as soon
as they're generated.

Run this command in your terminal to turn on this flag:

```bash
YOUR_PATH/TO/EXECUTABLE/Chrome --short-reporting-delay
```

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} This flag is not available via the Chrome UI, it's a command line flag only.
See [How to run Chromium with
flags](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags). {% endAside %}

### Use DevTools

In Chrome, use DevTools to see the reports that have been sent or will be sent.

As of October 2021, this feature is experimental. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Use Chrome version **96** and newer (check by typing `chrome://version` in your browser)
2. Type or paste `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` in Chrome's URL bar.
3. Click **Enabled**.
4. Restart your browser.
5. Open Chrome DevTools.
6. In Chrome DevTools, open the Settings. Under Experiments, click **Enable Reporting API panel in
   the Application panel**.
7. Reload DevTools.
8. Reload your page. Reports generated by the page DevTools is open in will be listed in Chrome

#### Report status

The **Status** column tells you if a report has been successfully sent.

<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Success</code></td>
        <td>The browser has sent the report and the endpoint replied with a success code (<code>200</code> or another success response code <code>2xx</code>).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Pending</code></td>
        <td>The browser is currently making an attempt to send the report.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Queued</code></td>
        <td>The report has been generated and the browser is not currently trying to send it. A report appears as <code>Queued</code> in one of these two cases:
        <ul>
          <li>The report is new and the browser is waiting to see if more reports arrive before trying to send it.</li>
          <li>The report is not new; the browser has already tried to send this report and has failed, and is waiting before trying again.</li>
        </ul>
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>MarkedForRemoval</code></td>
        <td>After retrying for a while (<code>Queued</code>), the browser has stopped trying to send the report and will soon remove it from its list of reports to send.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>

  </table>
</div>

Reports are removed after a while, whether or not they're successfully sent.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} The `Queued` status isn't always informative, because it doesn't precisely indicate whether sending has failed or has not been attempted yet. Using [short reporting delays](#save-time) helps: a report that remains `Queued` in that case likely indicates that sending is failing. {% endAside %}

### Troubleshooting

Are reports not generated or not sent as expected to your endpoint?
Here are a few tips to troubleshoot this.

#### Reports are not generated

Reports that show up in DevTools have been correctly generated.
If the report you expect does **not** show up in this list:

- Check `report-to` in your policies. If this is misconfigured, a
  report won't be generated. Head over to [Edit your policies](#edit-your-policies) to
  fix this. An additional way to troubleshoot this is to check the DevTools console in Chrome: if an
  error pops up in the console for the violation you expected, this means your policy is probably
  properly configured.
- Keep in mind that only the reports that were generated for the document DevTools is open in will
  show up in this list. One example: if your site `site1.example` embeds an iframe `site2.example`
  that violates a policy and hence generates a report, this report will show up in DevTools only if you open the
  iframe in its own window and open DevTools for that window.

#### Reports are generated but not sent or not received

What if you can see a report in DevTools, but your endpoint doesn't receive it?

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} Because the report is sent out-of-band by the browser itself and not by a
certain site, the `POST` requests containing the reports are not displayed in the **Network** panel of
your Developer Tools. {% endAside %}

- Make sure to use [short delays](#save-time). Maybe the reason you can't see a report is because it
  hasn't been sent yet!
- Check your `Reporting-Endpoints` header configuration. If there's an issue with it, a report that
  has been generated correctly will not be sent. In DevTools, the report's status will remain
  `Queued` (it might jump to `Pending`, and then quickly back to `Queued` when a delivery attempt is
  made) in this case. Some common mistakes that may cause this:

  - The endpoint is used but not configured. Example:

    {% Compare 'worse', 'Code with a mistake' %}

    ```http
    Document-Policy: document-write=?0;report-to=endpoint-1;
    Reporting-Endpoints: default="https://reports.example/default"
    ```

    {% CompareCaption %}

    Document-Policy violation reports should be sent to `endpoint-1`, but this endpoint name isn't configured in
    `Reporting-Endpoints`.

    {% endCompareCaption %}

    {% endCompare %}

  - The `default` endpoint is missing. Some reports types, such as deprecation and intervention
    reports, will only be sent to the endpoint named `default`. Read more in [Configure the
    Reporting-Endpoints header](#configure-the-reporting-endpoints-header).

- Look for issues in your policy headers syntax, such as missing quotes. [See
  details](#configure-the-reporting-endpoints-header).

- Check that your endpoint can handle incoming requests.

  - Make sure that your endpoint support CORS preflight requests. If it doesn't, it can't receive reports.

  - Test your endpoint's behavior. To do so, instead of generating
    reports manually, you can emulate the browser by sending to your endpoint requests that _look like_
    what the browser would send. Run the following:

    ```bash
    curl --header "Content-Type: application/reports+json" \
      --request POST \
      --data '[{"age":420,"body":{"columnNumber":12,"disposition":"enforce","lineNumber":11,"message":"Document policy violation: document-write is not allowed in this document.","policyId":"document-write","sourceFile":"https://dummy.example/script.js"},"type":"document-policy-violation","url":"https://dummy.example/","user_agent":"xxx"},{"age":510,"body":{"blockedURL":"https://dummy.example/img.jpg","destination":"image","disposition":"enforce","type":"corp"},"type":"coep","url":"https://dummy.example/","user_agent":"xxx"}]' \
      YOUR_ENDPOINT
    ```

    Your endpoint should respond with a success code (`200` or another success response code `2xx`). If it doesn't,
    there's an issue with its configuration.

## Related reporting mechanisms

### Report-Only

`-Report-Only` policy headers and the `Reporting-Endpoints` work together.

Endpoints configured in `Reporting-Endpoints` and specified in the `report-to` field of
[`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy),
[`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) and
[`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy), will receive reports when these policies are violated.

Endpoints configured in `Reporting-Endpoints` can also be specified in the `report-to` field of
[`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only),
[`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only`](/coop-coep/#:~:text=If%20you%20prefer%20to%20receive%20reports%20without%20blocking%20any%20embedded%20content%20or%20without%20isolating%20a%20popup%20window%2C%20append%20-Report-Only%20to%20respective%20headers) and
[`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy-Report-Only`](/coop-coep/#:~:text=If%20you%20prefer%20to%20receive%20reports%20without%20blocking%20any%20embedded%20content%20or%20without%20isolating%20a%20popup%20window%2C%20append%20-Report-Only%20to%20respective%20headers); they'll also receive reports when these policies are violated.

While reports are sent in both cases, `-Report-Only` headers do not enforce the policies: nothing will break or actually get blocked, but you will receive reports of what _would_ have broken or been blocked.

{% Aside %} If you're using a `-Report-Only` header and have configured your reporting endpoints via the legacy header `Report-To`, migrate to `Reporting-Endpoints` if you can. Read more in the [migration guide](/reporting-api-migration). {% endAside %}

### `ReportingObserver`

The [`ReportingObserver`](/reporting-observer) JavaScript API can help you observe client-side
warnings.

`ReportingObserver` and the `Reporting-Enpoints` header generate reports that look the same, but they enable slightly different uses cases.

Use `ReportingObserver` if:

- You only want to monitor deprecations and/or browser interventions. `ReportingObserver` surfaces **client-side warnings** such as deprecations and browser interventions, but unlike `Reporting-Endpoints`, it doesn't capture any other types of reports such as CSP
  or COOP/COEP violations.
- You need to react to these violations in real-time. `ReportingObserver` makes it possible to
  [attach a callback](/reporting-observer/#the-api) to a violation event.
- You want to attach additional information to a report to aid in debugging, via the custom [callback](/reporting-observer/#the-api).

Another difference is that `ReportingObserver` is configured only client-side:
you can use it even if you have no control over server-side headers and can't set `Reporting-Endpoints`.
