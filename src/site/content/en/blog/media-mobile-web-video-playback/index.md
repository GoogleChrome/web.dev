How do you create the best mobile media experience on the Web? Easy! It all
depends on user engagement and the importance you give to the media on a web
page. I think we all agree that if video is THE reason for a user's visit,
the user's experience has to be immersive and re-engaging.

In this article I show you how to enhance in a progressive way your media
experience and make it more immersive thanks to a plethora of Web APIs. That's
why we're going to build a simple mobile player experience with custom
controls, fullscreen, and background playback.
You can try the [sample] now and find [the code] in
our GitHub repository.

## Custom controls

<figcaption>
    <b>Figure 1.</b>HTML Layout
</figcaption>
</figure>

As you can see, the HTML layout we're going to use for our media player is
pretty simple: a `<div>` root element contains a `<video>` media element and a
`<div>` child element dedicated to video controls.

Video controls we will cover later, include: a play/pause button, a fullscreen
button, seek backward and forward buttons, and some elements for current time,
duration and time tracking.

```html
<div id="videoContainer">
  <video id="video" src="file.mp4"></video>
  <div id="videoControls"></div>
</div>
```

### Read video metadata

First, let's wait for the video metadata to be loaded to set the video
duration, the current time, and initialize the progress bar. Note that the
`secondsToTimeCode()` function is a custom utility function I've written that
converts a number of seconds to a string in "hh:mm:ss" format which is better
suited in our case.

```html
<div id="videoContainer">
  <video id="video" src="file.mp4"></video>
  <div id="videoControls">
    <strong>
      <div id="videoCurrentTime"></div>
      <div id="videoDuration"></div>
      <div id="videoProgressBar"></div>
    </strong>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
video.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', function () {
  videoDuration.textContent = secondsToTimeCode(video.duration);
  videoCurrentTime.textContent = secondsToTimeCode(video.currentTime);
  videoProgressBar.style.transform = `scaleX(${
    video.currentTime / video.duration
  })`;
});
```

<figure>

  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 2.</b> Media Player showing video metadata
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Play/pause video

Now that video metadata are loaded, let's add our first button that lets user
play and pause video with `video.play()` and `video.pause()` depending on its
playback state.

```html
<div id="videoContainer">
  <video id="video" src="file.mp4"></video>
  <div id="videoControls">
    <strong><button id="playPauseButton"></button></strong>
    <div id="videoCurrentTime"></div>
    <div id="videoDuration"></div>
    <div id="videoProgressBar"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
playPauseButton.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  if (video.paused) {
    video.play();
  } else {
    video.pause();
  }
});
```

{% Aside %}
I call `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent parent handlers (e.g. video
controls) from being notified of the click event.
{% endAside %}

Rather than adjusting our video controls in the `click` event listener, we use
the `play` and `pause` video events. Making our controls events based helps
with flexibility (as we'll see later with the Media Session API) and will allow
us to keep our controls in sync if the browser intervenes in the playback.
When video starts playing, we change the
button state to "pause" and hide the video controls. When the video pauses, we
simply change button state to "play" and show the video controls.

```js
video.addEventListener('play', function () {
  playPauseButton.classList.add('playing');
});

video.addEventListener('pause', function () {
  playPauseButton.classList.remove('playing');
});
```

When time indicated by video `currentTime` attribute changed via the
`timeupdate` video event, we also update our custom controls if they're
visible.

```js
video.addEventListener('timeupdate', function () {
  if (videoControls.classList.contains('visible')) {
    videoCurrentTime.textContent = secondsToTimeCode(video.currentTime);
    videoProgressBar.style.transform = `scaleX(${
      video.currentTime / video.duration
    })`;
  }
});
```

When the video ends, we simply change button state to "play", set video
`currentTime` back to 0 and show video controls for now. Note that we could
also choose to load automatically another video if the user has enabled some
kind of "AutoPlay" feature.

```js
video.addEventListener('ended', function () {
  playPauseButton.classList.remove('playing');
  video.currentTime = 0;
});
```

### Seek backward and forward

Let's continue and add "seek backward" and "seek forward" buttons so that user
can easily skip some content.

```html
<div id="videoContainer">
  <video id="video" src="file.mp4"></video>
  <div id="videoControls">
    <button id="playPauseButton"></button>
    <strong
      ><button id="seekForwardButton"></button>
      <button id="seekBackwardButton"></button
    ></strong>
    <div id="videoCurrentTime"></div>
    <div id="videoDuration"></div>
    <div id="videoProgressBar"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
var skipTime = 10; // Time to skip in seconds

seekForwardButton.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  video.currentTime = Math.min(video.currentTime + skipTime, video.duration);
});

seekBackwardButton.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  video.currentTime = Math.max(video.currentTime - skipTime, 0);
});
```

As before, rather than adjusting video styling in the `click` event listeners
of these buttons, we'll use the fired `seeking` and `seeked` video events to
adjust video brightness. My custom `seeking` CSS class is as simple as `filter: brightness(0);`.

```js
video.addEventListener('seeking', function () {
  video.classList.add('seeking');
});

video.addEventListener('seeked', function () {
  video.classList.remove('seeking');
});
```

Here's below what we have created so far. In the next section, we'll implement
the fullscreen button.

{% Video src="video/C47gYyWYVMMhDmtYSLOWazuyePF2/4pPp2OAaKod34JBXnM6S.webm", muted="true", controls="true" %}

## Fullscreen

Here we are going to take advantage of several Web APIs to create a perfect
and seamless fullscreen experience. To see it in action, check out the
[sample].

Obviously, you don't have to use all of them. Just pick the ones that make
sense to you and combine them to create your custom flow.

{% Video src="video/C47gYyWYVMMhDmtYSLOWazuyePF2/R6XO6uDeFCrWwhERgnAs.webm", muted="true", controls="true" %}

### Prevent automatic fullscreen

On iOS, `video` elements automagically enter fullscreen mode when media
playback begins. As we're trying to tailor and control as much as possible our
media experience across mobile browsers, I recommend you set the `playsinline`
attribute of the `video` element to force it to play inline on iPhone and not
enter fullscreen mode when playback begins. Note that this has no side effects
on other browsers.

```html
<div id="videoContainer"></div>
  <video id="video" src="file.mp4"></video><strong>playsinline</strong></video>
  <div id="videoControls">...</div>
</div>
```

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Set `playsinline` only if you provide your own media controls or show
native controls with `<video controls>`.
{% endAside %}

### Toggle fullscreen on button click

Now that we prevent automatic fullscreen, we need to handle ourselves the
fullscreen mode for the video with the [Fullscreen API]. When user
clicks the "fullscreen button", let's exit fullscreen mode with
`document.exitFullscreen()` if fullscreen mode is currently in use by the
document. Otherwise, request fullscreen on the video container with the method
`requestFullscreen()` if available or fallback to `webkitEnterFullscreen()` on
the video element only on iOS.

{% Aside %}
I'm going to use a [tiny shim] for the Fullscreen API in code snippets below that
will take care of prefixes as the API is not unprefixed yet at that time. You
may want to use [screenfull.js] wrapper as well.
{% endAside %}

```html
<div id="videoContainer">
  <video id="video" src="file.mp4"></video>
  <div id="videoControls">
    <button id="playPauseButton"></button>
    <button id="seekForwardButton"></button>
    <button id="seekBackwardButton"></button>
    <strong><button id="fullscreenButton"></button></strong>
    <div id="videoCurrentTime"></div>
    <div id="videoDuration"></div>
    <div id="videoProgressBar"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
fullscreenButton.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  if (document.fullscreenElement) {
    document.exitFullscreen();
  } else {
    requestFullscreenVideo();
  }
});

function requestFullscreenVideo() {
  if (videoContainer.requestFullscreen) {
    videoContainer.requestFullscreen();
  } else {
    video.webkitEnterFullscreen();
  }
}

document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', function () {
  fullscreenButton.classList.toggle('active', document.fullscreenElement);
});
```

{% Video src="video/C47gYyWYVMMhDmtYSLOWazuyePF2/do6eLAB1ZBJVVduYXzLM.webm", muted="true", controls="true" %}

### Toggle fullscreen on screen orientation change

As user rotates device in landscape mode, let's be smart about this and
automatically request fullscreen to create an immersive experience. For this,
we'll need the [Screen Orientation API] which is not yet supported
everywhere and still prefixed in some browsers at that time. Thus, this will be
our first progressive enhancement.

How does this work? As soon as we detect the screen orientation changes, let's
request fullscreen if the browser window is in landscape mode (that is, its
width is greater than its height). If not, let's exit fullscreen. That's all.

```js
if ('orientation' in screen) {
  screen.orientation.addEventListener('change', function () {
    // Let's request fullscreen if user switches device in landscape mode.
    if (screen.orientation.type.startsWith('landscape')) {
      requestFullscreenVideo();
    } else if (document.fullscreenElement) {
      document.exitFullscreen();
    }
  });
}
```

{% Aside %}
This may silently fail in browsers that don't [allow requesting
fullscreen from the orientation change
event](https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/commit/e5e96a9).
{% endAside %}

### Lock screen in landscape on button click

As video may be better viewed in landscape mode, we may want to lock screen in
landscape when user clicks the "fullscreen button". We're going to combine the
previously used [Screen Orientation API] and some [media
queries] to make sure this experience is the best.

Locking screen in landscape is as easy as calling
`screen.orientation.lock('landscape')`. However, we should do this only when
device is in portrait mode with `matchMedia('(orientation: portrait)')` and can
be held in one hand with `matchMedia('(max-device-width: 768px)')` as this
wouldn't be a great experience for users on tablet.

```js
fullscreenButton.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  if (document.fullscreenElement) {
    document.exitFullscreen();
  } else {
    requestFullscreenVideo();
    <strong>lockScreenInLandscape();</strong>;
  }
});
```

```js
function lockScreenInLandscape() {
  if (!('orientation' in screen)) {
    return;
  }
  // Let's force landscape mode only if device is in portrait mode and can be held in one hand.
  if (
    matchMedia('(orientation: portrait) and (max-device-width: 768px)').matches
  ) {
    screen.orientation.lock('landscape');
  }
}
```

{% Video src="video/C47gYyWYVMMhDmtYSLOWazuyePF2/Vb89fDuKAF9Cd2QzXUIe.webm", muted="true", controls="true" %}

### Unlock screen on device orientation change

You may have noticed the lock screen experience we've just created isn't
perfect though as we don't receive screen orientation changes when screen is locked.

In order to fix this, let's use the [Device Orientation API] if
available. This API provides information from the hardware measuring a device's
position and motion in space: gyroscope and digital compass for its
orientation, and accelerometer for its velocity. When we detect a device
orientation change, let's unlock screen with `screen.orientation.unlock()` if
user holds device in portrait mode and screen is locked in landscape mode.

```js
function lockScreenInLandscape() {
  if (!('orientation' in screen)) {
    return;
  }
  // Let's force landscape mode only if device is in portrait mode and can be held in one hand.
  if (matchMedia('(orientation: portrait) and (max-device-width: 768px)').matches) {
    screen.orientation.lock('landscape')
    <strong>.then(function() {
      listenToDeviceOrientationChanges();
    })</strong>;
  }
}
```

```js
function listenToDeviceOrientationChanges() {
  if (!('DeviceOrientationEvent' in window)) {
    return;
  }
  var previousDeviceOrientation, currentDeviceOrientation;
  window.addEventListener(
    'deviceorientation',
    function onDeviceOrientationChange(event) {
      // event.beta represents a front to back motion of the device and
      // event.gamma a left to right motion.
      if (Math.abs(event.gamma) > 10 || Math.abs(event.beta) < 10) {
        previousDeviceOrientation = currentDeviceOrientation;
        currentDeviceOrientation = 'landscape';
        return;
      }
      if (Math.abs(event.gamma) < 10 || Math.abs(event.beta) > 10) {
        previousDeviceOrientation = currentDeviceOrientation;
        // When device is rotated back to portrait, let's unlock screen orientation.
        if (previousDeviceOrientation == 'landscape') {
          screen.orientation.unlock();
          window.removeEventListener(
            'deviceorientation',
            onDeviceOrientationChange,
          );
        }
      }
    },
  );
}
```

As you can see, this is the seamless fullscreen experience we were looking for.
To see this in action, check out the [sample].

{% Video src="video/C47gYyWYVMMhDmtYSLOWazuyePF2/R6XO6uDeFCrWwhERgnAs.webm", muted="true", controls="true" %}

## Background playback

When you detect a web page or a video in the web page is not visible anymore,
you may want to update your analytics to reflect this. This could also affect
the current playback as in picking a different track, pause it, or even show
custom buttons to the user for instance.

### Pause video on page visibility change

With the [Page Visibility API], we can determine the current visibility of a
page and be notified of visibility changes. Code below pauses video when page
is hidden. This happens when screen lock is active or when you switch tabs for
instance.

As most mobile browsers now offer controls outside of the browser that allow
resuming a paused video, I recommend you set this behaviour only if user is
allowed to play in the background.

```js
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', function () {
  // Pause video when page is hidden.
  if (document.hidden) {
    video.pause();
  }
});
```

{% Aside %}
Chrome for Android already pauses videos when page is hidden.
{% endAside %}

### Show/hide mute button on video visibility change

If you use the new [Intersection Observer API], you can be even more granular
at no cost. This API lets you know when an observed element enters or exits the
browser's viewport.

Let's show/hide a mute button based on the video visibility in the page. If
video is playing but not currently visible, a mini mute button will be shown in
the bottom right corner of the page to give user control over video sound. The
`volumechange` video event is used to update the mute button styling.

{% Aside %}
If there are a lot of videos on a page, and it is using the Intersection
Observer API to pause / mute offscreen video, you may want to reset video
source with `video.src = null` instead since it will release significant
resources in an infinite scroll case.
{% endAside %}

```html
<button id="muteButton"></button>
```

```js
if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {
  // Show/hide mute button based on video visibility in the page.
  function onIntersection(entries) {
    entries.forEach(function (entry) {
      muteButton.hidden = video.paused || entry.isIntersecting;
    });
  }
  var observer = new IntersectionObserver(onIntersection);
  observer.observe(video);
}

muteButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
  // Mute/unmute video on button click.
  video.muted = !video.muted;
});

video.addEventListener('volumechange', function () {
  muteButton.classList.toggle('active', video.muted);
});
```

{% Video src="video/C47gYyWYVMMhDmtYSLOWazuyePF2/AiTL3QS7conUpqkeVW8l.webm", muted="true", controls="true" %}

### Play only one video at a time

If there are more than one video on a page, I would suggest you only play one
and pause the other ones automatically so that user doesn't have to hear
multiple audio tracks playing simultaneously.

```js
// This array should be initialized once all videos have been added.
var videos = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('video'));

videos.forEach(function (video) {
  video.addEventListener('play', pauseOtherVideosPlaying);
});

function pauseOtherVideosPlaying(event) {
  var videosToPause = videos.filter(function (video) {
    return !video.paused && video != event.target;
  });
  // Pause all other videos currently playing.
  videosToPause.forEach(function (video) {
    video.pause();
  });
}
```

### Customize Media Notifications

With the [Media Session API], you can also customize media
notifications by providing metadata for the currently playing video. It also
allows you to handle media related events such as seeking or track changing
which may come from notifications or media keys. To see this in action, check
out the [sample].

When your web app is playing audio or video, you can already see a media
notification sitting in the notification tray. On Android, Chrome does its best
to show appropriate information by using the document's title and the largest
icon image it can find.

Let's see how to customize this media notification by setting some media
session metadata such as the title, artist, album name, and artwork with the
[Media Session API].

```js
playPauseButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  if (video.paused) {
    video.play()
    <strong>.then(function() {
      setMediaSession();
    });</strong>
  } else {
    video.pause();
  }
});
```

```js
function setMediaSession() {
  if (!('mediaSession' in navigator)) {
    return;
  }
  navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({
    title: 'Never Gonna Give You Up',
    artist: 'Rick Astley',
    album: 'Whenever You Need Somebody',
    artwork: [
      {src: 'https://dummyimage.com/96x96', sizes: '96x96', type: 'image/png'},
      {
        src: 'https://dummyimage.com/128x128',
        sizes: '128x128',
        type: 'image/png',
      },
      {
        src: 'https://dummyimage.com/192x192',
        sizes: '192x192',
        type: 'image/png',
      },
      {
        src: 'https://dummyimage.com/256x256',
        sizes: '256x256',
        type: 'image/png',
      },
      {
        src: 'https://dummyimage.com/384x384',
        sizes: '384x384',
        type: 'image/png',
      },
      {
        src: 'https://dummyimage.com/512x512',
        sizes: '512x512',
        type: 'image/png',
      },
    ],
  });
}
```

Once playback is done, you don't have to "release" the media session as the
notification will automatically disappear. Keep in mind that current
`navigator.mediaSession.metadata` will be used when any playback starts. This
is why you need to update it to make sure you're always showing relevant
information in the media notification.

If your web app provides a playlist, you may want to allow the user to navigate
through your playlist directly from the media notification with some "Previous
Track" and "Next Track" icons.

```js
if ('mediaSession' in navigator) {
  navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('previoustrack', function () {
    // User clicked "Previous Track" media notification icon.
    playPreviousVideo(); // load and play previous video
  });
  navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('nexttrack', function () {
    // User clicked "Next Track" media notification icon.
    playNextVideo(); // load and play next video
  });
}
```

Note that media action handlers will persist. This is very similar to the event
listener pattern except that handling an event means that the browser stops
doing any default behaviour and uses this as a signal that your web app
supports the media action. Hence, media action controls won't be shown unless
you set the proper action handler.

By the way, unsetting a media action handler is as easy as assigning it to `null`.

The Media Session API allows you to show "Seek Backward" and "Seek Forward"
media notification icons if you want to control the amount of time skipped.

```js
if ('mediaSession' in navigator) {
  let skipTime = 10; // Time to skip in seconds

  navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekbackward', function () {
    // User clicked "Seek Backward" media notification icon.
    video.currentTime = Math.max(video.currentTime - skipTime, 0);
  });
  navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekforward', function () {
    // User clicked "Seek Forward" media notification icon.
    video.currentTime = Math.min(video.currentTime + skipTime, video.duration);
  });
}
```

The "Play/Pause" icon is always shown in the media notification and the related
events are handled automatically by the browser. If for some reason the default
behaviour doesn't work out, you can still [handle "Play" and "Pause" media
events].

The cool thing about the Media Session API is that the notification tray is not
the only place where media metadata and controls are visible. The media
notification is synced automagically to any paired wearable device. And it also
shows up on lock screens.
