## What is the getInstalledRelatedApps() API? {: #what }

    A website using <code>getInstalledRelatedApps()</code> to determine if its
    Android app is already installed.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The [`getInstalledRelatedApps()`][spec] makes it possible for *your* page to
check if *your* iOS/Android/desktop app, or Progressive Web App (PWA) is already installed
on a user's device, and allows you to customize the user experience if your
app is already installed.

For example, if your app is already installed:

* Redirecting the user from a product marketing page directly into your app.
* Centralizing some functionality like notifications in the other app to
  prevent duplicate notifications.
* Not [promoting the installation](/customize-install/) of your PWA if your
  other app is already installed.

<div class="w-clearfix"></div>

### Supported app types you can check

Your website can check if your:

* [Android app](#check-android) is installed
* [Windows (UWP) app](#check-windows) is installed
* Progressive Web App is installed, if it's running in the
  [same scope](#check-pwa-in-scope) or in a
  [different scope](#check-pwa-out-of-scope)

{% Aside %}
  The `getInstalledRelatedApps()` API only allows you to check if *your* apps
  are installed. You cannot get a list of all installed apps, or check if other
  3rd party apps are installed.
{% endAside %}

<!--  Android App -->

## Check if your Android app is installed {: #check-android }

Your website can check if your Android app is installed.

* Android: Chrome 80 or later

### Tell your Android app about your website

First, you'll need to update your Android app to define the relationship
between your website and Android application using the
[Digital Asset Links system][dig-asset-links]. This ensures that only your
website can check if your Android app is installed.

In the `AndroidManifest.xml` of your Android app, add an `asset_statements`
entry:

```xml
<manifest>
  <application>
   …
    <meta-data android:name="asset_statements" android:resource="@string/asset_statements" />
   …
  </application>
</manifest>
```

Then, in `strings.xml`, add the following asset statement, updating `site` with
your domain. Be sure to include the escaping characters.

```xml
<string name="asset_statements">
  [{
    \"relation\": [\"delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls\"],
    \"target\": {
      \"namespace\": \"web\",
      \"site\": \"https://example.com\"
    }
  }]
</string>
```

Once completed, publish your updated Android app to the Play store.

### Tell your website about your Android app

Next, tell your website about your Android app by
[adding a web app manifest](/add-manifest/) to your page. The manifest must
include the `related_applications` property, an array that provides the details
about your app, including `platform` and `id`.

* `platform` must be `play`
* `id` is the GooglePlay application ID for your Android app

```json
{
  "related_applications": [{
    "platform": "play",
    "id": "com.android.chrome",
  }]
}
```

### Check if your app is installed

Finally, call [`navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()`](#use) to check if your
Android app is installed.

Try the [demo](https://get-installed-apps.glitch.me/)

<!--  Windows App -->

## Check if your Windows (UWP) app is installed {: #check-windows }

Your website can check if your Windows app (built using UWP) is installed.

* Windows: Chrome 85 or later, Edge 85 or later

### Tell your Windows app about your website

You'll need to update your Windows app to define the relationship between your
website and Windows application using [URI Handlers][win-uri-handlers]. This
ensures that only your website can check if your Windows app is installed.

Add the `Windows.appUriHandler` extension registration to your app's manifest
file `Package.appxmanifest`. For example, if your website's address is
`example.com` you would add the following entry in your app's manifest:

```xml
<Applications>
  <Application Id="App" ... >
      ...
      <Extensions>
         <uap3:Extension Category="windows.appUriHandler">
          <uap3:AppUriHandler>
            <uap3:Host Name="example.com" />
          </uap3:AppUriHandler>
        </uap3:Extension>
      </Extensions>
  </Application>
</Applications>
```

Note, you may need to add the [`uap3` namespace][uap3-namespace] to your
`<Package>` attribute.

Then, create a JSON file (without the `.json` file extension) named
`windows-app-web-link` and provide your app's package family name. Place
that file either on your server root, or in the `/.well-known/` directory. You
can find the package family name in the Packaging section in the app manifest
designer.

```json
[{
  "packageFamilyName": "MyApp_9jmtgj1pbbz6e",
  "paths": [ "*" ]
}]
```

See [Enable apps for websites using app URI handlers][win-uri-handlers] for
complete details on setting up URI handlers.

### Tell your website about your Windows app

Next, tell your website about your Windows app by
[adding a web app manifest](/add-manifest/) to your page. The manifest must
include `related_applications` property, an array that provides the details
about your app, including `platform` and `id`.

* `platform` must be `windows`
* `id` is your app's package family name, appended by the `<Application>` `Id`
  value in your `Package.appxmanifest` file.

```json
{
  "related_applications": [{
    "platform": "windows",
    "id": "MyApp_9jmtgj1pbbz6e!App",
  }]
}
```

### Check if your app is installed

Finally, call [`navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()`](#use) to check if your
Windows app is installed.

<!--  PWA - in scope -->

## Check if your Progressive Web App is already installed (in scope) {: #check-pwa-in-scope }

Your PWA can check to see if it is already installed. In this case, the page
making the request must be on the same domain, and within the [scope][scope]
of your PWA, as defined by the scope in the web app manifest.

* Android: Chrome 84 or later

### Tell your PWA about itself

Tell your PWA about itself by adding a `related_applications` entry in your
PWAs [web app manifest](/add-manifest/).

* `platform` must be `webapp`
* `url` is the full path to the web app manifest of your PWA

```json
{
  …
  "scope": "/",
  "start_url": "/",
  "related_applications": [{
    "platform": "webapp",
    "url": "https://example.com/manifest.json",
  }],
  …
}
```

### Check if your PWA is installed

Finally, call [`navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()`](#use) from within the
[scope][scope] of your PWA to check if it is installed. If
`getInstalledRelatedApps()` is called outside the scope of your PWA, it will
return false. See the next section for details.

Try the [demo](https://gira-same-domain.glitch.me/pwa/)

<!--  PWA - NOT in scope -->

## Check if your Progressive Web App is installed (out of scope)  {: #check-pwa-out-of-scope }

Your website can check if your PWA is installed, even if the page is outside
the [scope][scope] of your PWA. For example, a landing page served from
`/landing/` can check if the PWA served from `/pwa/` is installed, or if your
landing page is served from `www.example.com` and your PWA is served from
`app.example.com`.

* Android: Chrome 84 or later

### Tell your PWA about your website

First, you'll need to add digital asset links to the server where your PWA is
served from. This will help define the relationship between your website and
your PWA, and ensures that only your website can check if your PWA is installed.

Add an `assetlinks.json` file to the [`/.well-known/`][well-known] directory
of the domain where the PWA lives, for example `app.example.com`. In the `site`
property, provide the full path to the web app manifest that will perform
the check (not the web app manifest of your PWA).

```json
// Served from https://app.example.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.query_webapk"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "web",
      "site": "https://www.example.com/manifest.json"
    }
  }
]
```

{% Aside %}
  Double check the file name when you create your `assetlinks.json` file,
  I've wasted many hours debugging, only to realize I'd added an extra 's' in
  the file name.
{% endAside %}

### Tell your website about your PWA

Next, tell your website about your PWA app by
[adding a web app manifest](/add-manifest/) to your page. The manifest must
include the `related_applications` property, an array that provides the details
about your PWA, including `platform` and `url`.

* `platform` must be `webapp`
* `url` is the full path to the web app manifest of your PWA

```json
{
  "related_applications": [{
    "platform": "webapp",
    "url": "https://app.example.com/manifest.json",
  }]
}
```

### Check if your PWA is installed

Finally, call [`navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()`](#use) to check if your
PWA is installed.

Try the [demo](https://gira-same-domain.glitch.me/)

<!--  Use the API-->

## Calling getInstalledRelatedApps() {: #use }

Calling `navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps()` returns a promise that
resolves with an array of your apps that are installed on the user's device.

```js
const relatedApps = await navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps();
relatedApps.forEach((app) => {
  console.log(app.id, app.platform, app.url);
});
```

To prevent sites from testing an overly broad set of their own apps,
only the first three apps declared in the web app manifest will be
taken into account.

Like most other powerful web APIs, the `getInstalledRelatedApps()` API is
only available when served over **HTTPS**.
