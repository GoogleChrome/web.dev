After 10 years and 100 million pageviews this 
[commit](https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/pull/1548) completes 
our transition of content of HTML5Rocks to homes that are maintained on 
[developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/) and 
[web.dev](https://web.dev/). It feels like a bit of an end of an era.

I was around for the founding of HTML5Rocks. We had so much fun building the 
serving infrastructure (several times) and creating a lot of the content—from 
walkthroughs of WebSQL and AppCache, the first introductions to new APIs such as 
IndexedDB, and explainers for How the Browser works.

Our most popular article was about CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing), 
followed by dragging and dropping files, and then one of the first introductions 
to getUserMedia and WebRTC. Contrasting the popularity of core "simple" tasks 
against the new and shiny capabilities is something that impacts developers 
today just as much as it did in 2012.

One thing I will miss the most is the community that developed around the site. 
HTML5Rocks was the first public site I helped to create that managed to build a 
huge community around it. It was one of the quickest ways to get feedback from 
developers that could be fed right back into the browser engineering teams. 
However, over the last couple of years as our priorities changed, "HTML5" became 
"HTML", and we slowly stopped creating new content and engaging with the 
community on the site. As the founders of our team moved on, I was left as the 
only person who could deploy the site and so I felt it was time to ensure that 
we had a permanent home that has a dedicated team supporting both the content 
and the infrastructure.

With this transition it was important for us to maintain the content (it's still 
valuable), but more importantly maintain the in-bound links. People found our 
content interesting enough for them to share with their audiences, so I'd like 
to maintain that trust given to us and ensure that all the links will still 
resolve to the content. If you do see an issue with any of the content, reach out
to us and file an issue on 
[web.dev](https://github.com/googlechrome/web.dev/issues) or 
[developer.chrome.com](https://github.com/googlechrome/developer.chrome.com/issues) 
issue trackers.

Thank you to everyone who wrote content for the site, for the people who 
translated the content so that it could be read everywhere, and all the readers 
and commenters who made the site the place to go and learn about what's new on 
the web.

I'm off to register HTMLLivingStandardRocks.com...

♥️ Paul
