Set a redirect from `/.well-known/change-password` to the change password page
of your website. This will enable password managers to navigate your users
directly to that page.

## Introduction

As you may know, [passwords are not the best way to manage
accounts](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/11/new-research-understanding-root-cause.html).
Luckily, there are emerging technologies such as
[WebAuthn](https://webauthn.io/) and techniques such as one-time passwords that
are helping us get closer to a world without passwords. However, these
technologies are still being developed and things won't change rapidly. Many
developers will still need to deal with passwords for at least the next few
years. While we wait for the emerging technologies and techniques to become
commonplace, we can at least make passwords easier to use.

A good way to do this is to provide better support for password managers.

### How password managers help

Password managers can be built into browsers or provided as third-party apps.
They can help users in various ways:

**Autofill the password for the correct input field**: Some browsers can find
the correct input heuristically even if the website is not optimized for this
purpose. Web developers can help password managers by correctly [annotating HTML
input tags](https://web.dev/sign-in-form-best-practices/#new-password).

**Prevent phishing**: Because password managers remember where the password was
recorded, the password can be autofilled only at appropriate URLs, and not at
phishing websites.

**Generate strong and unique passwords**: Because strong and unique passwords
are directly generated and stored by the password manager, users don't have to
remember a single character of the password.

Generating and autofilling passwords using a password manager have already
served the web well, but considering their lifecycle, updating the passwords
whenever it's required is as important as generating and autofilling. To
properly leverage that, password managers are adding a new feature:

**Detect vulnerable passwords and suggest updating them**: Password managers can
detect passwords that are reused, analyze the entropy and weakness of them, and
even detect potentially leaked passwords or ones that are known to be unsafe
from sources such as [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

A password manager can warn users about problematic passwords, but there's a lot
of friction in asking users to navigate from the homepage to a change password
page, on top of going through the actual process of changing the password (which
varies from site to site). It would be much easier if password managers could
navigate the user directly to the change-password URL. This is where [a
well-known URL for changing
passwords](https://wicg.github.io/change-password-url/) becomes useful.

By reserving a well-known URL path that redirects the user to the change
password page, the website can easily redirect users to the right place to
change their passwords.


## Set up "a well-known URL for changing passwords"

`.well-known/change-password` is proposed as [a well-known URL for changing
passwords](https://wicg.github.io/change-password-url/). All you have to do is
to configure your server to redirect requests for `.well-known/change-password`
to the change password URL of your website.

For example, let's say your website is `https://example.com` and the change
password URL is `https://example.com/settings/password`. You'll just need to set
your server to redirect a request for
`https://example.com/.well-known/change-password` to
`https://example.com/settings/password`. That's it. For the redirection, [use
the HTTP status code](https://wicg.github.io/change-password-url/#semantics)
[`302 Found`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302), [`303 See
Other`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/303) or [`307
Temporary Redirect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307).

Alternatively you can serve HTML at your `.well-known/change-password` URL with
a `<meta>` tag using an
[`http-equiv="refresh"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-http-equiv).

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=https://example.com/settings/password">
```

### Revisit your change password page HTML

The goal of this feature is to help the user's password lifecycle be more fluid.
You can do two things to empower the user to update their password without
friction:

* If your change-password form needs the current password, add
  `autocomplete="current-password"` to the `<input>` tag to help the password
  manager autofill it.
* For the new password field (in many cases it's two fields to ensure that the
  user has entered the new password correctly), add
  `autocomplete="new-password"` to the `<input>` tag to help the password
  manager suggest a generated password.

## How it is used in real world

### Examples

Thanks to Apple Safari's
[implementation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-13-release-notes),
`/.well-known/change-password`, has already been available on some major
websites for a while:

* [Google](https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/change-password)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/.well-known/change-password)  
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/.well-known/change-password)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/.well-known/change-password)
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/.well-known/change-password)

Try them yourself and do the same for yours!

### Browser compatibility

A well-known URL for changing passwords has been [supported in Safari since
2019](https://webkit.org/blog/9170/safari-technology-preview-84-with-safari-13-features-is-now-available/).
Chrome's password manager is starting to support it from version 86 onwards
(which is scheduled for Stable release in late October 2020)
and other Chromium-based browsers may follow. [Firefox considers it worth
implementing](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/#change-password-url),
but has not signalled that it plans to do so as of August 2020.

### Chrome's password manager behavior

Let's have a look at how Chrome's password manager treats vulnerable passwords.

Chrome's password manager is able to check for leaked passwords. By navigating
to `chrome://settings/passwords` users can run **Check passwords** against stored
passwords, and see a list of passwords that are recommended for update.

  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

By clicking the <b>Change password</b> button next to a password that is recommended to
be updated, the browser will:

* Open the website's change password page if `/.well-known/change-password` is
  set up correctly.
* Open the website's homepage if `/.well-known/change-password` is not set up
  and Google doesn't know the fallback.

{% DetailsSummary %}
What if the server returns `200 OK` even `/.well-known/change-password` doesn't exist?
{% endDetailsSummary %}

Password managers try to determine if a website supports a well-known URL for
changing passwords by sending a request to `/.well-known/change-password` before
actually forwarding a user to this URL. If the request returns `404 Not Found`
it is obvious that the URL is not available, but a `200 OK` response doesn't
necessarily mean that the URL is available, because there are a few edge cases:

* A server-side-rendering website displays "Not found" when there is no content
  but with `200 OK`.
* A server-side-rendering website responds with `200 OK` when there is no
  content after redirecting to the "Not found" page.
* A single page app responds with the shell with `200 OK` and renders the "Not
  found" page on the client side when there is no content.

For these edge cases users will be forwarded to a "Not Found" page and that will
be a source of confusion.

That's why there's [a proposed standard
mechanism](https://wicg.github.io/change-password-url/response-code-reliability.html)
to determine whether the server is configured to respond with `404 Not Found`
when there is genuinely no content, by requesting a random page. Actually, the
URL is also reserved:
`/.well-known/resource-that-should-not-exist-whose-status-code-should-not-be-200`.
Chrome for example uses this URL path to determine whether it can expect a
proper change password URL from `/.well-known/change-password` in advance.

When you are deploying `/.well-known/change-password`, make sure that your
server returns `404 Not Found` for any non-existing contents.
