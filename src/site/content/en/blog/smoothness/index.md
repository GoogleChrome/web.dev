You've probably experienced pages that "stutter" or "freeze" during scrolling or
animations. We like to say that these experiences are not _smooth_. To address
these types of issues, the Chrome team has been working on adding more support
to our lab tooling for animation detection, as well as making steady improvements
to the rendering pipeline diagnostics within Chromium.

We'd like to share some recent progress, offer concrete tooling guidance, and
discuss ideas for future animation smoothness metrics. As always, we would love
to hear your [feedback](#feedback).

This post will cover three main topics:

- A quick look at animations and animation frames.
- Our current thoughts on measuring overall animation smoothness.
- A few practical suggestions for you to leverage in lab tooling today.

## What are animations?

Animations bring content to life! By making content move, especially in response
to user interactions, animations can make an experience feel more natural,
understandable, and fun.

But poorly implemented animations, or just adding too many animations, can
degrade the experience and make it decidedly not fun at all. We've probably all
interacted with an interface which just added too many "helpful" transition
effects, which actually become hostile to experience when they perform poorly.
Some users therefore actually might
[prefer reduced motion](/prefers-reduced-motion/), a user preference
that you should honor.

animations using developer
tooling](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/animations/).
{% endAside %}

### How do animations work?

As a quick recap, the [rendering pipeline](/animations-overview/#pipeline)
consists of a few, **sequential** stages:

1. <strong style="font-weight:700;color:#6251A2">Style:</strong> Calculate the
   styles that apply to the elements.
2. <strong style="font-weight:700;color:#6251A2">Layout:</strong> Generate the
   geometry and position for each element.
3. <strong style="font-weight:700;color:#78A55A">Paint:</strong> Fill out the
   pixels for each element into layers.
4. <strong style="font-weight:700;color:#78A55A">Composite:</strong> Draw the
   layers to the screen.

While there are many ways to define animations, they all fundamentally work via
one of the following:

- Adjusting <strong style="font-weight:700;color:#6251A2">layout</strong>
  properties.
- Adjusting <strong style="font-weight:700;color:#78A55A">paint</strong>
  properties.
- Adjusting <strong style="font-weight:700;color:#78A55A">composite</strong>
  properties.

Because these stages are sequential, it is important to define animations in
terms of properties that are further down the pipeline. The earlier the update
happens in the process, the greater are the costs and it's less likely to be
smooth. (See [Rendering
performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering)
for more details.)

While it can be convenient to animate layout properties, there are costs to
doing so, even if those costs aren't immediately apparent. Animations should be
defined in terms of composite property changes wherever possible.

Defining [declarative CSS animations or using Web
Animations](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/animations/css-vs-javascript),
and ensuring you [animate composite
properties](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/hardware-accelerated-animations/),
is a great first step to ensuring smooth and efficient animations. But still,
this alone does not guarantee smoothness because even efficient web animations
have performance limits. That's why it is always important to measure!

## What are animation frames?

Updates to the visual representation of a page take time to appear. A visual
change will lead to a new animation frame, which is eventually rendered on the
user's display.

Displays update on some interval, so visual updates are batched. Many displays
update on a fixed interval of time, such as 60 times a second (that is
60&nbsp;Hz). Some more modern displays can offer higher refresh rates
(90–120&nbsp;Hz are becoming common). Often these displays can actively adapt
between refresh rates as needed, or even offer fully variable frame rates.

The goal for any application, like a game or a browser, is to process all these
batched visual updates and produce a visually complete animation frame within
the deadline, every time. Note that this goal is entirely distinct from other
important browser tasks such as loading content from the network quickly or
executing JavaScript tasks efficiently.

At some point, it can become too difficult to complete all visual updates within
the allotted deadline assigned by the display. When this happens, the browser
**drops a frame**. Your screen doesn't go black, it just repeats itself. You see
the same visual update for a bit longer—the same animation frame that was
presented at the previous frame opportunity.

This actually happens often! It is not necessarily even perceptible, especially
for static or document-like content, which is common on the web platform in
particular. Dropped frames only become apparent when there are important visual
updates, such as animations, for which we need a steady stream of animation
updates to show smooth motion.

## What impacts animation frames?

Web developers can greatly impact the ability of a browser to quickly and
efficiently render and present visual updates!

Some examples:

- Using content that is too large or resource-intensive to decode quickly on the
  target device.
- [Using too many
  layers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/stick-to-compositor-only-properties-and-manage-layer-count)
  requiring too much GPU memory.
- Defining overly complex CSS styles or web animations.
- Using design anti-patterns that disable fast rendering optimizations.
- Too much JS work on the main thread, leading to long tasks that block visual
  updates.

But how can you know when an animation frame has missed its deadline and caused
a dropped frame?

One possible method is using
[`requestAnimationFrame()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
polling, however it has several downsides. `requestAnimationFrame()`, or "rAF",
tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and asks for an
opportunity to do so before the next paint stage of the rendering pipeline. If
your callback function isn't called at the time you expect it, that means a
paint wasn't executed, and one or more frames were skipped. By polling and
counting how often rAF is called, you can compute a sort of "frames per second"
(FPS) metric.

{% Aside 'warning' %}
  The following code is an anti-pattern and is strongly discouraged!
{% endAside %}

```js
let frameTimes = [];
function pollFramesPerSecond(now) {
  frameTimes = [...frameTimes.filter(t => t > now - 1000), now];
  requestAnimationFrame(pollFramesPerSecond);
  console.log('Frames per second:', frameTimes.length);
}
requestAnimationFrame(pollFramesPerSecond);
```

Using `requestAnimationFrame()` polling is not a good idea for several reasons:

- Every script has to set up its own polling loop.
- It can block the critical path.
- Even if the rAF polling is fast, it can prevent
  [`requestIdleCallback()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/requestIdleCallback)
  from being able to schedule long idle blocks when used continuously (blocks that
  exceed a single frame).
- Similarly, lack of long idle blocks prevents the browser from scheduling other
  long-running tasks (such as longer garbage collection and other background or
  speculative work).
- If polling is toggled on and off, then you'll miss cases where frame budget
  has been exceeded.
- Polling will report false-positives in cases where the browser is using
  variable update frequency (for example, due to power or visibility status).
- And most importantly, it doesn't actually capture all types of animation
  updates!

Too much work on the main thread can impact the ability to see animation frames.
Check out the [Jank
Sample](https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/jank/) to see how a
rAF-driven animation, once there is too much work on the main thread (such as
layout), will lead to dropped frames and fewer rAF callbacks, and lower FPS.

When the main thread becomes bogged down, visual updates begin to stutter.
That's jank!

Many measurement tools have focused extensively on the ability for the main
thread to yield in a timely manner, and for animation frames to run smoothly.
But this is not the whole story! Consider the following example:

{% Video
  src="video/nM10iAStORWg0YlDbPc2czmpRRr2/xkdE00Gizsks9ytPkP6r.mov",
  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  controls="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true"
%}

The video above shows a page that periodically injects long tasks onto the main
thread. These long tasks completely ruin the ability of the page to provide
certain types of visual updates, and you can see in the top-left corner a
corresponding drop of `requestAnimationFrame()` reported FPS to 0.

And yet, despite these long tasks, the page continues to scroll smoothly. This
is because on modern browsers, [scrolling is often
threaded](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/08/scrolling-on-the-web/#:~:text=The%20multithreaded%20web),
driven entirely by the compositor.

This is an example that simultaneously contains many dropped frames on the main
thread, yet still has many successfully-delivered frames of scrolling on the
compositor thread. Once the long task is complete, the main thread paint update
has no visual change to offer anyway. rAF polling suggested a frame drop to 0,
but _visually_, a user wouldn't be able to notice a difference!

For animation frames, the story is not that simple.

{% Aside %}
There are many reasons why long tasks are bad—and these are captured
  with [dedicated performance APIs](/custom-metrics/), such as the Long Tasks
  API or the Event Timing API. Yet, there are also features, such as
  [`isInputPending()`](/isinputpending/), where long tasks during idle periods
  may be added entirely by design and be a good thing.
{% endAside %}


## Animation frames: Updates that matter

The above example showcases that there is more to the story than just
`requestAnimationFrame()`.

So when do animation updates and animation frames matter?  Here are
some criteria we're thinking about and would love to get feedback on:

- Main and compositor thread updates
- Missing paint updates
- Detecting animations
- Quality versus quantity

### Main and compositor thread updates

Animation frame updates are not boolean. It is not the case that frames may only
be fully dropped or fully presented. There are many reasons why an animation
frame may be _partially_ _presented_. In other words, it can simultaneously have
_some stale content_ while also having _some new visual updates_ which are
presented.

The most common example of this is when the browser is unable to produce a new
main thread update within frame deadline but does have a new compositor thread
update (such as the threaded scrolling example from earlier).

One important reason why using declarative animations to animate composite
properties is recommended is that doing so enables an animation to be driven
entirely by the compositor thread even when the main thread is busy. These types
of animations can continue to produce visual updates efficiently and in
parallel.

On the other hand, there may be cases where a main thread update finally becomes
available for presentation, but only after missing several frame deadlines. Here
the browser will have _some_ new update, but it may not be _the very latest_.

Broadly speaking, we consider frames that contain some new visual updates,
without all new visual updates, as a _partial frame_. Partial frames are fairly
common. Ideally, partial updates would at least include the most important
visual updates, like animations, but that can only happen if animations are
driven by the compositor thread.

### Missing paint updates

Another type of partial update is when media like images have not finished
decoding and rasterizing in time for frame presentation.

Or, even if a page is perfectly static, browsers may still fall behind rendering
visual updates during rapid scrolling. That is because the pixel renditions of
content beyond the visible viewport may be discarded to save GPU memory. It
takes time to render pixels, and it may take longer than a single frame to
render everything after a large scroll, like a finger fling. This is commonly
known as _checkerboarding_.

With each frame rendering opportunity, it's possible to track how much of the
latest visual updates actually got to the screen. Measuring the ability to do so
over many frames (or time) is broadly known as _frame throughput_.

If the GPU is really bogged down, the browser (or platform) may even begin to
throttle the rate at which it attempts visual updates and thus decreases
effective frame rates. While technically that can reduce the number of dropped
frame updates, visually it will still appear as a lower frame throughput.

Yet, not all types of low frame throughput are bad. If the page is mostly idle
and there are no active animations, a low frame rate is just as visually
appealing as a high frame rate (and, it can save battery!).

So when does frame throughput matter?

### Detecting animations

High frame throughput matters especially during periods with important
animations. Different animation types will depend on visual updates from a
specific thread (main, compositor, or a worker), so its visual update is
dependent on that thread providing its update within the deadline. We say that a
given thread _affects smoothness_ whenever there is an active animation that
depends on that thread update.

Some types of animations are easier to define and detect than others.
Declarative animations, or user-input-driven animations, are clearer to define
than JavaScript-driven animations implemented as periodic updates to animatable
style properties.

Even with `requestAnimationFrame()` you
cannot always assume that every rAF call is necessarily producing a visual
update or animation. For example, using rAF polling just to track frame rate
(as shown above) should not itself affect smoothness measurements since there is
no visual update.

{% Aside %}
  Animation detection in tooling, as well as the specifics of
  animation implementations in browsers, continually evolves and improves.
  Chrome recently moved [background-color
  animations](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/hardware-accelerated-animations/#whats-coming-next)
  from the main thread to the compositor!
{% endAside %}

### Quality versus quantity

Finally, detecting animations and animation frame updates is still only part of
the story because it only captures the quantity of animation updates, not the
quality.

For example, you may see a steady framerate of of 60&nbsp;fps while watching a
video. Technically, this is perfectly smooth, but the video itself may have a
low bit rate, or issues with network buffering. This isn't captured by
animation smoothness metrics directly, yet may still be jarring to the
user.

Or, a game which leverages `<canvas>` (perhaps even using techniques like
[offscreen
canvas](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/offscreen-canvas) to
ensure a steady frame rate) may technically be perfectly smooth in terms of
animation frames, all while failing to load high quality game assets into the
scene or exhibiting rendering artifacts.

And of course, a site can just have some really lame animations 🙂

I mean, I guess they were pretty cool for their time!

## States of a single animation frame

Because frames may be partially presented, or dropped frames may happen in ways
that do not affect smoothness, we have begun to think of each frame as having a
completeness or smoothness score.

Here is the spectrum of ways in which we interpret the state of a single
animation frame, ordered from best to worst case:

<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style="width:12em"><strong style="background:#BCD5AC;padding:0.25em;">
        No Update Desired</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Idle time, repeat of the previous frame.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#BCD5AC;padding:0.25em;">
        Fully presented</strong>
      </td>
      <td>The main thread update was either committed within deadline, or no
      main thread update was desired.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#BCD5AC;padding:0.25em;">
        Partially presented</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Compositor only; the delayed main thread update had no visual
      change.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#DCE9D5;padding:0.25em;">
        Partially presented</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Compositor only; the main thread had a visual update, but that
      update did not include an animation that affects smoothness.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#E9ECC2;padding:0.25em;">
        Partially presented</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Compositor only; the main thread had a visual update that affects
      smoothness, but a previously stale frame arrived and was used instead.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#FDF2D0;padding:0.25em;">
        Partially presented</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Compositor only; without the desired main update, and the
      compositor update has an animation that affects smoothness.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#EECDCD;padding:0.25em;">
        Partially presented</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Compositor only but the compositor update does not have an
      animation that affects smoothness.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#EECDCD;padding:0.25em;">
        Dropped frame</strong>
      </td>
      <td>No update. There was no compositor update desired, and main was
      delayed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#DE9D9B;padding:0.25em;">
        Dropped frame</strong>
      </td>
      <td>A compositor update was desired, but it was delayed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style="background:#DE9D9B;padding:0.25em;">
        Stale frame</strong>
      </td>
      <td>An update was desired, it was produced by the renderer, but the
      GPU still did not present it before the vsync deadline.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

It's possible to turn these states into somewhat of a score. And perhaps one way
to interpret this score is to consider it a _probability_ of being observable by
the user. A single dropped frame may not be very observable, but a sequence of
many dropped frames affecting smoothness in a row sure is!

## Putting it all together: A Percent Dropped Frames metric

While it can sometimes be necessary to dive deep into the state of each
animation frame, it's also useful to just assign a quick "at a glance" score for
an experience.

Because frames may be _partially presented,_ and because even fully skipped
frame updates may not actually _affect smoothness_, we want to focus less on
just counting frames, and more on the _extent_ to which the browser is unable to
provide _visually complete_ updates _when it mattered_.

The mental model should move from:

1. *Frames Per Second*, to
2. Detecting missing and important animation updates, to
3. *Percentage Dropped* over a given time period.

What matters is: _the proportion of time waiting for important
updates_. We think this matches the natural way users experience the smoothness
of web content in practice. So far, we have been using the following as an
initial set of metrics:

- **Average Percent Dropped:** for all non-idle animation frames throughout the
  whole timeline
- **Worst Case of Percent Dropped Frames:** as measured over 1 second sliding
  windows of time.
- **95th percentile of Percent Dropped Frames:** as measured over 1 second
  sliding windows of time.

You can find these scores in some Chrome developer tools today. While these
metrics focus only on overall frame throughput, we are also evaluating other
factors, such as frame latency.

{% Aside %}
  These names are somewhat historical. The "Percent Dropped" naming no longer
  matches any literal "was a frame dropped" concept. As the previous section
  covered, each animation frame is a complicated arrangement of conditions
  leading to an overall probability. Expect these names to evolve over time.
{% endAside %}

## Try it yourself in developer tooling!

### Performance HUD

Chromium has a neat Performance HUD hidden behind a flag
(`chrome://flags/#show-performance-metrics-hud`). In it, you can find live
scores for things like Core Web Vitals and also a few experimental definitions
for animation smoothness based on *Percent Dropped Frames* over time.

{% Img src="image/eqprBhZUGfb8WYnumQ9ljAxRrA72/hblBG5oYxWsUOua0tW3C.png",

### Frame Rendering Stats

[Enable "Frame Rendering
Stats"](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#fps-meter)
in DevTools via Rendering settings to see a live view of new animation frames,
which are color-coded to differentiate partial updates from fully-dropped frame
updates. The reported fps is for fully-presented frames only.

alt="Frame rendering stats", width="398", height="372" %}

### Frame Viewer in DevTools performance profile recordings

The [DevTools Performance
panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/) has
long had a [Frames
viewer](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/reference/#frames).
However, it had grown a bit out of sync with how the modern rendering pipeline
actually works. There has been plenty of recent improvement, even in the latest
Chrome Canary, which we think will greatly ease debugging animation issues.

Today you will find that frames in the frames viewer are better aligned with
vsync boundaries, and color-coded based on status. There is still not full
visualization for all the nuances outlined above, but we're planning to add more
in the near future.

alt="Frame viewer in Chrome DevTools", width="800", height="148" %}

### Chrome tracing

Finally, with Chrome Tracing, the tool of choice for diving deep into details,
you can record a "Web content rendering" trace via the new [Perfetto
UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/) (or `about:tracing`), and dig deep into Chrome's
graphics pipeline. It can be a daunting task, but there are a few things
recently added to Chromium to make it easier. You can get an overview of what is
available in the [Life of a
Frame](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/life_of_a_frame.md)
document.

Through trace events you can definitively determine:

- Which animations are running (using events named `TrackerValidation`).
- Getting the exact timeline of animation frames (using events named
  `PipelineReporter`).
- For janky animation updates, figure out exactly what is blocking your
  animation from running faster (using the event breakdowns within
  `PipelineReporter` events).
- For input-driven animations, see how long it takes to get a visual update
  (using events named `EventLatency`).

## What's next

The [Web Vitals](/vitals/) initiative aims to provide metric and guidance for
building great user experiences on the web.
[Lab-based](/user-centric-performance-metrics/#in-the-lab) metrics like [Total
Blocking Time (TBT)](/tbt/) and [Time to Interactive (TTI)](/tti/) are vital for
catching and diagnosing potential interactivity issues. We are planning to
design a similar lab-based metric for animation smoothness.

We'll keep you posted as we continue to work through ideas for designing a
comprehensive metric based on individual animation frame data.

In the future, we'd also like to design APIs that make it possible to measure
animation smoothness performantly for real users in the
[field](/user-centric-performance-metrics/#in-the-field) as well as in the lab.
Stay tuned for updates there as well!
