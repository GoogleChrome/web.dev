{% Aside 'warning' %}
This article describes an old version of Shadow DOM (v0). If you're interested in using Shadow DOM, check out our new article at developers.google.com, "[Shadow DOM v1: self-contained web components](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/shadowdom/)". It covers everything in the newer Shadow DOM v1 spec shipping in Chrome 53, Opera, and Safari 10.

## Introduction

Web Components is a set of cutting edge standards that:

1. Make it possible to build widgets
1. …which can be reused reliably
1. …and which won’t break pages if the next version of the component
changes internal implementation details.

Does this mean you have to decide when to use HTML/JavaScript, and
when to use Web Components? No! HTML and JavaScript can make
interactive visual stuff. Widgets are interactive visual stuff. It
makes sense to leverage your HTML and JavaScript skills when
developing a widget. The Web Components standards are designed to help
you do that.

{% Aside %}
It doesn’t make sense to have to switch to a different technology to
build a widget. For example, I’m definitely not a fan of making your
widget out of a `<canvas>`. It is reliable — pages
won’t break if you change what it paints — but it’s hostile to
accessibility, indexing, composition, and resolution independence.
{% endAside %}


But there is a fundamental problem that makes widgets built out of
HTML and JavaScript hard to use: The DOM tree inside a widget isn’t
encapsulated from the rest of the page. This lack of encapsulation
means your document stylesheet might accidentally apply to parts
inside the widget; your JavaScript might accidentally modify parts
inside the widget; your IDs might overlap with IDs inside the widget;
and so on.

{% Aside %}
A particularly pernicious aspect of the lack of encapsulation is that
if you upgrade the library and the internal details of the widget’s
DOM changes, your styles and scripts might break in unpredictable
ways.
{% endAside %}

Web Components is comprised of four
parts:

1. [Templates](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/templates/index.html)
1. [Shadow DOM](http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/)
1. [Custom Elements](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/custom/index.html)
1. [Packaging](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/explainer/index.html#external-custom-elements-and-decorators)


**Shadow DOM** addresses the DOM tree encapsulation problem. The
four parts of Web Components are designed to work together, but you
can also pick and choose which parts of Web Components to use. This
tutorial shows you how to use Shadow DOM.

Shadow DOM is now available in Chrome 35+.

## Hello, Shadow World

With Shadow DOM, elements can get a new kind of node associated with
them. This new kind of node is called a **shadow root**. An element that has a shadow root associated with it is called a **shadow
host.** The content of a shadow host isn’t rendered; the content of
the shadow root is rendered instead.

For example, if you had markup like this:

```html
<button>Hello, world!</button>
<script>
var host = document.querySelector('button');
var root = host.createShadowRoot();
root.textContent = 'こんにちは、影の世界!';
</script>
```

then instead of

```html
<button id="ex1a">Hello, world!</button>
<script>
function remove(selector) {
  Array.prototype.forEach.call(
      document.querySelectorAll(selector),
      function (node) { node.parentNode.removeChild(node); });
}

if (!HTMLElement.prototype.createShadowRoot) {
  remove('#ex1a');
  document.write('<img src="SS1.png" alt="Screenshot of a button with \'Hello, world!\' on it.">');
}
</script>
```

your page looks like

```html
<button id="ex1b">Hello, world!</button>
<script>
(function () {
  if (!HTMLElement.prototype.createShadowRoot) {
    remove('#ex1b');
    document.write('<img src="SS2.png" alt="Screenshot of a button with \'Hello, shadow world!\' in Japanese on it.">');
    return;
  }
  var host = document.querySelector('#ex1b');
  var root = host.createShadowRoot();
  root.textContent = 'こんにちは、影の世界!';
})();
</script>
```

Not only that, if JavaScript on the page asks what the button’s
`textContent` is, it isn’t going to get
“こんにちは、影の世界!”, but “Hello, world!” because the DOM subtree
under the shadow root is encapsulated.

## Separating Content from Presentation

Now we'll look at using Shadow DOM to separate content from
presentation. Let's say we have this name tag:

```html
<style>
.ex2a.outer {
  border: 2px solid brown;
  border-radius: 1em;
  background: red;
  font-size: 20pt;
  width: 12em;
  height: 7em;
  text-align: center;
}
.ex2a .boilerplate {
  color: white;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 0.5em;
}
.ex2a .name {
  color: black;
  background: white;
  font-family: "Marker Felt", cursive;
  font-size: 45pt;
  padding-top: 0.2em;
}
</style>
<div class="ex2a outer">
  <div class="boilerplate">
    Hi! My name is
  </div>
  <div class="name">
    Bob
  </div>
</div>
```

Here is the markup. This is what you’d write today. It doesn’t
use Shadow DOM:


```html
<style>
.outer {
  border: 2px solid brown;
  border-radius: 1em;
  background: red;
  font-size: 20pt;
  width: 12em;
  height: 7em;
  text-align: center;
}
.boilerplate {
  color: white;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  padding: 0.5em;
}
.name {
  color: black;
  background: white;
  font-family: "Marker Felt", cursive;
  font-size: 45pt;
  padding-top: 0.2em;
}
</style>
<div class="outer">
  <div class="boilerplate">
    Hi! My name is
  </div>
  <div class="name">
    Bob
  </div>
</div>
```

Because the DOM tree lacks encapsulation, the entire structure of the
name tag is exposed to the document. If other elements on the page
accidentally use the same class names for styling or scripting, we're
gonna have a bad time.


We can avoid having a bad time.

### Step 1: Hide Presentation Details

Semantically we probably only care that:

- It is a name tag.
- The name is “Bob”.

First, we write markup that is closer to the true semantics we want:

```html
<div id="nameTag">Bob</div>
```

Then we put all of the styles and divs used for presentation into
a `<template>` element:

```html
<div id="nameTag">Bob</div>
<template id="nameTagTemplate">
<span class="unchanged"><style>
.outer {
  border: 2px solid brown;

  … same as above …

</style>
<div class="outer">
  <div class="boilerplate">
    Hi! My name is
  </div>
  <div class="name">
    Bob
  </div>
</div></span>
</template>
```

At this point ‘Bob’ is the only thing that is rendered. Because we
moved the presentational DOM elements inside
a `<template>` element, they aren’t rendered, but
they __can__ be accessed from JavaScript. We do that now to
populate the shadow root:

```html
<script>
var shadow = document.querySelector('#nameTag').createShadowRoot();
var template = document.querySelector('#nameTagTemplate');
var clone = document.importNode(template.content, true);
shadow.appendChild(clone);
```

{% Aside %}
Templates, like Shadow DOM, are an emerging
standard. The `<template>` element is available in [many modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=template). You can also populate a shadow root using familiar
properties and methods like `innerHTML`, `appendChild`, `getElementById`,
and so on. This article is focused on Shadow DOM, so we won’t go
further into how the template element works here. If you want to learn
more about `<template>`, see [HTML's New Template Tag](https://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/webcomponents/template/).
{% endAside %}

Now that we have set up a shadow root, the name tag is rendered
again. If you were to right-click on the name tag and inspect the
element you see that it is sweet, semantic markup:

```html
<div id="nameTag">Bob</div>
```

This demonstrates that, by using Shadow DOM, we have hidden the
presentation details of the name tag from the document. The
presentation details are encapsulated in the Shadow DOM.

### Step 2: Separate Content from Presentation

Our name tag now hides presentation details from the page, but it
doesn’t actually separate presentation from content, because although
the content (the name “Bob”) is in the page, the name that is rendered
is the one we copied into the shadow root. If we want to change the
name on the name tag, we’d need to do it in two places, and they might
get out of sync.

HTML elements are compositional — you can put a button inside a table,
for example. Composition is what we need here: The name tag must be a
composition of the red background, the “Hi!” text, and the content
that is on the name tag.

You, the component author, define how composition works with your
widget using a new element called `<content>`. This
creates an insertion point in the presentation of the widget, and the
insertion point cherry-picks content from the shadow host to present
at that point.

If we change the markup in the Shadow DOM to this:

```html
<span class="unchanged"><template id="nameTagTemplate">
<style>
  …
</style></span>
<div class="outer">
  <div class="boilerplate">
    Hi! My name is
  </div>
  <div class="name">
    <content></content>
  </div>
</div>
<span class="unchanged"></template></span>
```

When the name tag is rendered, the content of the shadow host is
projected into the spot that the `<content>` element
appears.

Now the structure of the document is simpler because the name is only
in one place — the document. If your page ever needs to update the
user’s name, you just write:

```js
document.querySelector('#nameTag').textContent = 'Shellie';
```

and that is it. The rendering of the name tag is automatically updated
by the browser, because we're **projecting** the content of the
name tag into place with `<content>`.

```html
<div id="ex2b">
```

Now we have achieved separation of content and presentation. **The
content is in the document; the presentation is in the Shadow DOM.**
They are automatically kept in sync by the browser when it comes time
to render something.

### Step 3: Profit

By separating content and presentation, we can simplify the
code that manipulates the content — in the name tag example, that
code only needs to deal with a simple structure containing
one `<div>` instead of several.

Now if we change our presentation, we don't need to change any of the
code!

For example, say we want to localize our name tag. It is still a name
tag, so the semantic content in the document doesn’t change:

```html
<div id="nameTag">Bob</div>
```

The shadow root setup code stays the same. Just what gets put in the
shadow root changes:

```html
<template id="nameTagTemplate">
<style>
.outer {
  border: 2px solid pink;
  border-radius: 1em;
  background: url(sakura.jpg);
  font-size: 20pt;
  width: 12em;
  height: 7em;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
}
.name {
  font-size: 45pt;
  font-weight: normal;
  margin-top: 0.8em;
  padding-top: 0.2em;
}
</style>
<div class="outer">
  <div class="name">
    <content></content>
  </div>
  と申します。
</div>
</template>
```

This is a big improvement over the situation on the web today, because
your name update code can depend on the structure of the
__component__ which is simple and consistent. **Your name
update code doesn’t need to know the structure used for
rendering.** If we consider what is rendered, the name appears
second in English (after “Hi! My name is”), but first in Japanese
(before “と申します”). That distinction is semantically meaningless
from the point of view of updating the name that is being displayed,
so the name update code doesn’t have to know about that detail.

## Extra Credit: Advanced Projection

In the above example, the `<content>` element
cherry-picks all of the content from the shadow host. By using the
`select` attribute, you can control what
a content element projects. You can also use multiple content
elements.

For example, if you have a document which contains this:

```html
<div id="nameTag">
  <div class="first">Bob</div>
  <div>B. Love</div>
  <div class="email">bob@</div>
</div>
```

and a shadow root which uses CSS selectors to select specific content:

```html
<div style="background: purple; padding: 1em;">
  <div style="color: red;">
    <content **select=".first"**></content>
  </div>
  <div style="color: yellow;">
    <content **select="div"**></content>
  </div>
  <div style="color: blue;">
    <content **select=".email">**</content>
  </div>
</div>
```

{% Aside %}
`select` can only
select elements which are immediate children of the host node. That is, you
cannot select descendants (e.g.`select="table tr"`).
{% endAside %}

The `<div class="email">` element is matched by both
the `<content select="div">` and `<content
select=".email">` elements. How many times does Bob’s email
address appear, and in what colors?

The answer is that Bob’s email address appears once, and it is yellow.

The reason is that, as people who hack on Shadow DOM know,
constructing the tree of what is actually rendered on screen is like a
huge party. **The content element is the invitation that lets
content from the document into the backstage Shadow DOM rendering
party.** These invitations are delivered in order; who gets an
invitation depends on to whom it is addressed (that is,
the `select` attribute.) Content, once
invited, always accepts the invitation (who wouldn’t?!) and off it
goes. If a subsequent invitation is sent to that address again, well,
nobody is home, and it doesn’t come to your party.

In the above example, `<div class="email">` matches
both the `div` selector and the `.email`
selector, but because the content element with the `div`
selector comes earlier in the document,
`<div class="email">` goes to the yellow party, and
nobody is available to come to the blue party. (That might
be __why__ it is so blue, although misery loves company, so you
never know.)

If something is invited to __no__ parties, then it doesn’t get
rendered at all. That is what happened to the “Hello, world” text in
the very first example. This is useful when you want to achieve a
radically different rendering: Write the semantic model in the
document, which is what is accessible to scripts in the page, but hide
it for rendering purposes and connect it to a really different
rendering model in Shadow DOM using JavaScript.

For example, HTML has a nice date picker. If you write `<input
type="date">` you get a neat pop-up calendar. But what if you
want to let the user pick a range of dates for their __dessert__
island vacation (you know… with hammocks made out of Red Vines.) You
set up your document this way:


``html
<div class="dateRangePicker">
  <label for="start">Start:</label>
  <input type="date" name="startDate" id="start">
  <br>
  <label for="end">End:</label>
  <input type="date" name="endDate" id="end">
</div>
```

but create Shadow DOM that uses a table to create a slick calendar
which highlights the range of dates and so on. When the user clicks on
the days in the calendar, the component updates the state in the
startDate and endDate inputs; when the user submits the form, the
values from those input elements get submitted.

Why did I include labels in the document if they’re not going to be
rendered? The reason is that if a user views the form with a browser
that doesn’t support Shadow DOM, the form is still usable, just not as
pretty. The user sees something like:

```html
<div class="dateRangePicker">
  <label for="start">Start:</label>
  <input type="date" name="startDate" id="start">
  <br>
  <label for="end">End:</label>
  <input type="date" name="endDate" id="end">
</div>
```

## You Pass Shadow DOM 101

Those are the basics of Shadow DOM — you pass Shadow DOM 101! You can
do more with Shadow DOM, for example, you can use multiple shadow on
one shadow host, or nested shadows for encapsulation, or architect
your page using Model-Driven Views (MDV) and Shadow DOM. And Web
Components are more than just Shadow DOM.

We explain those in later posts. Now,
