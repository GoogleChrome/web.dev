We've been analyzing the results of the
[2019 Mozilla Developer Network Web DNA Report](https://mdn-web-dna.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MDN-Web-DNA-Report-2019.pdf)
for action items and follow up strategies to improve the top reported issues.
A small sub-group on the Chrome team identified a group of issues related
to scrolling, `scroll-snap`, and `touch-action`. Those issues were researched,
evaluated, and synthesized into a new, follow-up survey with more precise
questions about issues related to these topics.

## 2021 Scroll Survey

We believe that there are many ways to improve scrolling on the web for
developers, designers, and users alike. We've created a survey which we
hope is respectful of your time. It should take no more than 10 minutes
to complete. The results will help browser vendors and standards groups
understand how to make scrolling better.

You can take part in the survey at [2021 Web Scrolling Survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bjbaTccU1lpPlVX).
