{% Aside %}
  The Notification Triggers API, part of Google's
  [capabilities project](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities),
  is currently in development. This post will be updated as the
  implementation progresses.
{% endAside %}

## What are Notification Triggers? {: #what }

Web developers can display notifications using the
[Web Notifications API](https://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/). This feature is often used
with the [Push API](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/) to inform the user of
time-sensitive information, such as breaking news events or received messages. Notifications are
shown by running JavaScript on the user's device.

The problem with the Push API is that it's not reliable for triggering notifications which _must_ be
shown when a particular condition, like time or location, is met. An example of a _time-based
condition_ is a calendar notification that reminds you of an important meeting with your boss at
2&nbsp;PM. An example of a _location-based condition_ is a notification that reminds you to buy milk
when you enter the vicinity of your grocery store. Network connectivity or battery-preserving
features like doze mode can delay the delivery of push based notifications.

Notification triggers solve this problem by letting you schedule notifications with their triggering
condition in advance, so that the operating system will deliver the notification at the right time
even if there is no network connectivity or the device is in battery saver mode.

{% Aside %}
  For now, Chrome only supports _time-based triggers_. Additional triggers, such as
  location-based triggers, may be added in the future based on developer demand.
{% endAside %}

### Use cases {: #use-cases }

Calendar applications can use time-based notification triggers to remind a user of upcoming
meetings. The default notification scheme for a calendar app could be to show a first heads-up
notification one hour before a meeting and then another more urgent notification five minutes
before.

A TV network might remind users that their favorite TV show is about to start or a conference live
stream is about to begin.

Time zone conversion sites can use time-based notification triggers to let their users schedule
alarms for telephone conferences or video calls.

## How to use notification triggers {: #use }

### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with the Notification Triggers API locally, without an origin trial token, enable the
`#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` flag in `chrome://flags`.

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

Starting in Chrome 80, the Notification Triggers API will be available as an origin trial.

{% include 'content/origin-trials.njk' %}

Once you're registered,
{% include 'content/origin-trial-register.njk' %}

### Feature detection

You can find out if the browser supports Notification Triggers by checking for the existence of the
`showTrigger` property:

```js
if ("showTrigger" in Notification.prototype) {
  /* Notification Triggers supported */
}
```

### Scheduling a notification

Scheduling a notification is similar to showing a regular push notification,
except that you need to pass a `showTrigger` condition property with a `TimestampTrigger` object as
the value to the notification's `options` object.

```js/5
const createScheduledNotification = async (tag, title, timestamp) => {
  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration();
  registration.showNotification(title, {
    tag: tag,
    body: "This notification was scheduled 30 seconds ago",
    showTrigger: new TimestampTrigger(timestamp + 30 * 1000)
  });
};
```

{% Aside %}
  On desktop, notification triggers fire only if Chrome is running.
  On Android, they fire regardless.
{% endAside %}

### Canceling a scheduled notification

To cancel scheduled notifications, first request a list of all notifications that match a
certain tag through `ServiceWorkerRegistration.getNotifications()`. Note that you need to pass the
`includeTriggered` flag for scheduled notifications to be included in the list:

```js/4
const cancelScheduledNotification = async (tag) => {
  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration();
  const notifications = await registration.getNotifications({
    tag: tag,
    includeTriggered: true,
  });
  notifications.forEach((notification) => notification.close());
};
```

### Debugging

You can use the [Chrome DevTools Notifications panel][devtools] to debug notifications.
To start debugging, press **Start recording events** ![Start recording events](record.png) or
<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> on Mac). Chrome DevTools
records all notification events, including scheduled, displayed, and closed notifications,
for three days, even when DevTools is closed.

### Demo

You can see Notification Triggers in action in the [demo][demo], which allows you to schedule
notifications, list scheduled notifications, and cancel them. The source code is available on
[Glitch][demo-source].

## Security and permissions

The Chrome team has designed and implemented the Notification Triggers API using the core
principles defined in [Controlling Access to Powerful Web Platform Features][powerful-apis],
including user control, transparency, and ergonomics. Because this API requires service workers,
it also requires a secure context. Using the API requires the same permission as regular push
notifications.

### User control

This API is only available in the context of a `ServiceWorkerRegistration`. This implies that all
required data is stored in the same context and is automatically deleted when the service worker is
deleted or the user deletes all site data for the origin. Blocking cookies also prevents service
workers from being installed in Chrome, and therefore this API from being used.
Notifications can always be disabled by the user for the site in site settings.

### Transparency

Unlike the Push API, this API does not depend on the network, which implies scheduled notifications
need all required data beforehand, including image resources referenced by the `badge`,
`icon` and `image` attributes. This means showing a scheduled notification is not observable by the
developer and doesn't involve waking up the service worker until the user interacts with the
notification. Consequently, there is currently no known way the developer could obtain information
about the user through potentially privacy-invading approaches like IP address geolocation lookup.
This design also allows the feature to optionally tap into scheduling mechanisms provided by
the operating system like Android's
[`AlarmManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager), which helps
preserve battery.

## Feedback {: #feedback }
