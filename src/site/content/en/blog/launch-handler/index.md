title: Control how your app is launched
subhead: |
  Launch handler lets you control how your app is launched, e.g., whether it uses an existing
  window and whether the chosen window is navigated to the launch URL. This also enqueues a
  `LaunchParams` object in the launched page's `window.launchQueue`, similar to the File
  Handling API.
