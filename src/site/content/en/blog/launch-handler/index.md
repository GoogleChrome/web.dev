title: Control how your app is launched
subhead: >
  Launch handler lets you control how your app is launched, for example, whether it uses an existing or a new
  window and whether the chosen window is navigated to the launch URL. This also enqueues a
  `LaunchParams` object in the launched page's `window.launchQueue`, similar to the File
  Handling API.

{% Aside %} The Launch Handler API is part of the [capabilities project](/fugu-status/) and is
currently in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses. {% endAside %}

## What is the Launch Handler API? {: #what }

There are many ways to launch a Progressive Web App. Probably the most common is via the icon on the
home screen or the app drawer of the device. But when you think about it, there are many other ways
a launch can happen:

- A share action when the app is a
  [share target](/web-share-target/).
- A user click in the file explorer opening the PWA, which
  acts as a [file handler](/file-handling/).
- A registered [protocol handler](/protocol-handling/) that the PWA may launch as the
  result of a matching protocol.
- A click on a
  [push notification](/push-notifications-overview/) or an [app icon shortcut](/app-shortcuts/).

There are even more ways, but you get the idea. Given the manifold possibilities for launching PWAs,
what has been missing is a way to let apps customize their launch behavior across all types of app
launch triggers. The `launch_handler` manifest member together with the `window.launchQueue`
interface enables PWAs to do just that.

### Suggested use cases for the Launch Handler API {: #use-cases }

Examples of sites that may use this API include:

- Apps that prefer to only have a single instance of themselves open at any time, with new
  navigations focusing the existing instance. Examples include apps like music players or games,
  where it generally makes sense to only have one instance of the app open at any time.
- Apps that enable multi-document management, but within their own single instance, for example, an
  HTML-implemented tab strip, floating sub-windows, or apps using
  [tabbed application mode](/tabbed-application-mode/).

## How to use the Launch Handler API {: #use }

### Enabling via about://flags

To experiment with the Launch Handler API locally, without an origin trial token, enable the
`#enable-desktop-pwas-launch-handler` flag in `about://flags`.

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

Starting in Chromium&nbsp;98, the Launch Handler API will be available as an origin trial in
Chromium. The origin trial is expected to end in Chromium&nbsp;102 (June&nbsp;15, 2022).

{% include 'content/origin-trials.njk' %}

### Register for the origin trial {: #register-for-ot }

{% include 'content/origin-trial-register.njk' %}

### Feature detection

To check if the Launch Handler API is supported, use:

```javascript
if ('launchQueue' in window && 'targetURL' in LaunchParams.prototype) {
  // The Launch Handler API is supported.
}
```

### The `launch_handler` manifest member

To declaratively specify the launch behavior of your app, add the `launch_handler` manifest member
to your manifest. It has two sub-fields, `route_to` and `navigate_existing_client`. The former lets
you control whether a new or an existing client should be launched, and the latter how and if this
client should be navigated. The Web App Manifest excerpt below shows a file with
exemplary values that would always route all launches to a new client.

```json
{
  "launch_handler": {
    "route_to": "new-client",
    "navigate_existing_client": "always"
  }
}
```

If unspecified, `launch_handler` defaults to
`{"route_to": "auto", "navigate_existing_client": "always"}`. The allowed values for the sub-fields
are as follows:

- `route_to`:

  - `new-client`: A new browsing context is created in a web app window to load the launch's target
    URL.
  - `existing-client`: An existing browsing context is used, specifically the one most recently used. How the launch is handled within that
    browsing context depends on `navigate_existing_client`.
  - `auto`: The behavior is up to the user agent to decide what works best for the platform. For
    example, mobile devices only support single clients and would use `existing-client`, while
    desktop devices support multiple windows and would use `new-client` to avoid data loss.

- `navigate_existing_client`:
  - `always`: Existing browsing contexts chosen for launch will navigate the browsing context to the
    launch's target URL.
  - `never`: Existing browsing contexts chosen for launch will not be navigated and instead have
    `targetURL` in the enqueued `LaunchParams` set to the launch's target URL.

{% Aside 'warning' %}
Careful, setting `navigate_existing_client` to `always` can cause data loss. Only use this
when it is safe to do so (for example, in a music player), or make sure the user's data gets
saved before navigating away from the previous location.
{% endAside%}

Both `route_to` and `navigate_existing_client` also accept a list (array) of values, where the first
valid value will be used. This is to allow new values to be added to the spec without breaking
backwards compatibility with existing implementations.

For example, if the hypothetical value `"matching-url-client"` were added, sites would specify
`"route_to": ["matching-url-client", "existing-client"]` to continue to control the behavior of
older browsers that did not support `"matching-url-client"`.

### The `window.launchQueue` interface

If the app has declared that it wants to handle launches in an existing client (by specifying
`"route_to": "existing-client"`), it can imperatively do something with incoming launch URLs.
This is where the `launchQueue` comes into play. To access launch target URLs, a site needs to
specify a consumer for the `window.launchQueue` object, which is then passed the target URL via the
`launchParams.targetURL` field. Launches are queued until they are handled by the specified
consumer, which is invoked exactly once for each launch. In this manner, every launch is handled,
regardless of when the consumer was specified. The code snippet below shows a fictive audio player
PWA that extracts a song ID from a target URL that it is potentially passed on launch.

```js
launchQueue.setConsumer((launchParams) => {
  const songID = extractSongId(launchParams.targetURL);
  if (songID) {
    playSong(songID);
  }
});
```

## Demo

You can see a demo of the Launch Handler API in action in the [PWA Launch Handler Demo][demo]. Be
sure to check out the [source code][demo-source] of the application to see how it uses the Launch
Handler API.
