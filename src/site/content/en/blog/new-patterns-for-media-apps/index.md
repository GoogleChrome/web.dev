Let's welcome our new collection of [media patterns](/patterns/media) to help you create modern media experiences on the web for great audio and video playback:

1. [Use the Web Audio API to add effects to audio sources](/patterns/media/media-session/)
2. [Let the user control media playback on the lock screen, in a widget, or with hardware keys](/patterns/media/audio-effects/)
3. [Record audio from the user's microphone](/patterns/media/microphone-record/)
4. [Create a custom Picture-in-Picture button for your video player](/patterns/media/picture-in-picture/)
5. [Record the user's screen](/patterns/media/screen-record/)

We hope these patterns will help you build amazing apps, and I'm looking forward to your feedback! You can provide feedback by tweeting at [@ChromiumDev](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev) or [filing an Issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/issues/new/choose).
