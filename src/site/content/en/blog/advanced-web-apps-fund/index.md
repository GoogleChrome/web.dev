Over the years, Chrome has been adding new capabilities to the web, such as File System Access and WebTransport, and has made further investments in technologies like WebAssembly. The web is now more capable than ever, enabling developers to bring to the web highly capable applications like [Photoshop](/ps-on-the-web).

Though the Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, we're responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend on countless others in the community who have built a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools, demonstration apps, and other materials. To help recognize the importance of this work and to enable more people to spend time on these projects, we're thrilled to announce today the launch of the Advanced Web Apps Fund: a new fund to support the web as a platform for advanced apps. 

## What kind of projects are you looking for?

Anything that improves the web as a platform for advanced apps is fair game. We don’t have a precise definition for “advanced apps” but we generally consider it to be websites that have an app-like interface and significant client-side functionality. To help illustrate how we’re thinking about it, here are some ideas our team came up with:
- New capabilities (e.g. a WebSQL replacement using WebAssembly)
- Libraries and tools that make it easier to build advanced web apps, such as improvements to [Bubblewrap](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap) and drivers supporting WebUSB
- Demo apps and tutorials showcasing unique or powerful use cases for advanced web apps

## Requirements

Anyone can apply, but you need an Open Collective account. You can apply for a project you own or nominate a project that you think deserves support. If you don't own the project, you'll need to ensure that the project’s core maintainers would be willing to accept the PRs for the code changes you’re seeking funding for, as a prerequisite for sponsorship being approved.

## How to apply

To apply, create a short document describing what you’re proposing. For existing projects, you can also file a GitHub issue in your project. Then, fill out [this submission form](https://forms.gle/GnTuCvDW3YhzSnBQ8). There’s no deadline; we’ll evaluate proposals on a rolling basis.
