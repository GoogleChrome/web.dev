All modules in the [Learn HTML](/learn/html/) course are now
available. This course was written by [Estelle Weyl](https://front-end.social/@estelle) and takes you through an in-depth journey to really understand HTML. 

You can read them in whatever order you'd like. The final modules, launched today, are:

- [Forms](/learn/html/forms/)
- [Images](/learn/html/images/)
- [Audio and video](/learn/html/audio-video/)
- [Template, slot, and shadow](/learn/html/template/)
- [HTML APIs](/learn/html/apis/)
- [Focus](/learn/html/focus/)
- [Other inline text elements](/learn/html/inline-text/)
- [Details and summary](/learn/html/details/)
- [Dialog](/learn/html/dialog/)

I've been writing HTML for a very long time, and I learned things while editing this course. There really is a lot more to HTML than you might think, and it's definitely worth revisiting some of the things you think you already know. Take a look, and don't forget to check out some of the [other courses in our growing collection](/learn/).
