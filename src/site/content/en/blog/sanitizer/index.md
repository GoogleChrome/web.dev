# Safe DOM manipulation with the Sanitizer API

Applications deal with untrusted strings all the time, but safely rendering that content as part of an HTML document can be tricky. Without sufficient care, it's easy to accidentally create opportunities for [cross-site scripting](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/) (XSS) that malicious attackers may exploit.

To mitigate that risk, the new [Sanitizer API](https://wicg.github.io/sanitizer-api/) aims to build a robust processor for arbitrary strings to be safely inserted into a page. This article introduces the API, and explains its usage.

```js
// Expanded Safely !!
$div.setHTML(`<em>hello world</em><img src="" onerror=alert(0)>`, new Sanitizer())
```

## Escaping user input contents

When inserting user input, query strings, cookie contents, and so on, into the DOM, the strings must be escaped properly. Particular attention should be paid to the DOM manipulation via `.innerHTML`, where unescaped strings are a typical source of XSS.

```js
const user_input = `<em>hello world</em><img src="" onerror=alert(0)>`
$div.innerHTML = user_input
```

If you escape HTML special characters in the input string above or expand it using `.textContent`, `alert(0)` will not be executed. However, since `<em>` added by the user is also expanded as a string as it is, this method cannot be used in order to keep the text decoration in HTML.

What the developer wants to do here is not **Escaping**, but **Sanitizing**.


## Sanitizing user input contents

The difference between "**Escape**" and "**Sanitize**" is as follows

Escape: replace HTML special characters with [HTML Entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Entity).

Sanitize: remove semantically harmful parts (such as script execution) from HTML string.

In the previous example, `<img onerror>` causes the error handler to be executed, but if the `onerror` handler was removed, it would be possible to safely expand it in the DOM while leaving `<em>` intact.

```js
// XSS ðŸ§¨
$div.innerHTML = `<em>hello world</em><img src="" onerror=alert(0)>`
// Sanitized â›‘
$div.innerHTML = `<em>hello world</em><img src="">`
```

To sanitize correctly, it is necessary to parse the input string as HTML, omit tags and attributes that are considered harmful, and keep the harmless ones.

The Sanitizer API is [a proposed specification](https://wicg.github.io/sanitizer-api/) that aims to provide such processing as a standard API for browsers.

{% Aside %}
IE had implemented `window.toStaticHTML()` for this purpose, but it was never standardized.
{% endAside %}


## Sanitizer API

The [Sanitizer API](https://wicg.github.io/sanitizer-api/) is used in the following way.

```js
const $div = document.querySelector('div')
const user_input = `<em>hello world</em><img src="" onerror=alert(0)>`
const sanitizer = new Sanitizer()
$div.setHTML(user_input, sanitizer) // <div><em>hello world</em><img src=""></div>

```

It is worth noting that `setHTML()` is defined on `[Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element)`. Being a method of Element, the context to parse is self-explanatory (`<div>` in this case), the parsing is done once internally, and the result is directly expanded into the DOM.

If you don't want to expand directly into the DOM, you can also get the result as an `HTMLElement`.


```js
const user_input = `<em>hello world</em><img src="" onerror=alert(0)>`
const sanitizer = new Sanitizer()
sanitizer.sanitizeFor("div", user_input) // HTMLDivElement <div>
```

If you want to get the result of sanitization as a string, you can use `.innerHTML` from the `HTMLElement` you got here. (You still need to specify the appropriate context to parse.)


```js
sanitizer.sanitizeFor("div", user_input).innerHTML // <em>hello world</em><img src="">
```

If you already have a user-controlled `DocumentFragment` and you want to remove only the harmful stuff from it, use `sanitize()`.


```js
$div.replaceChildren(s.sanitize($userDiv));
```


### Customize via configuration

The Sanitizer API is configured by default to remove strings that would trigger script execution. However, you can also add your own customizations to the sanitization process via configuration object.


```js
const config = {
  allowElements: [],
  blockElements: [],
  dropElements: [],
  allowAttributes: {},
  dropAttributes: {},
  allowCustomElements: true,
  allowComments: true
};
// sanitized result is customized by configuration
new Sanitizer(config)
```

The following options specify how the sanitization result should treat the specified element.

**`allowElements`**: Names of elements that the sanitizer should retain.

**`blockElements`**: Names of elements the sanitizer should remove, while retaining their children.

**`dropElements`**: Names of elements the sanitizer should remove, along with their children.


```js
const str = `hello <b><i>world</i></b>`

new Sanitizer().sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div>hello <b><i>world</i></b></div>

new Sanitizer({allowElements: [ "b" ]}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div>hello <b>world</b></div>

new Sanitizer({blockElements: [ "b" ]}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div>hello <i>world</i></div>

new Sanitizer({allowElements: []}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div>hello world</div>
```

You can also control how the sanitizer treats the specified attributes with the following options:

**`allowAttributes`**: Attribute Match List to allow

**`dropAttributes`**: Attribute Match List to drop

The attribute properties expect **Attribute Match Lists** - objects whose keys are attribute names, and values are lists of target elements or the "**`*`**" wildcard.


```js
const str = `<span id=foo class=bar style="color: red">hello</span>`

new Sanitizer().sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div><span id="foo" class="bar" style="color: red">hello</span></div>

new Sanitizer({allowAttributes: {"style": ["span"]}}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div><span style="color: red">hello</span></div>

new Sanitizer({allowAttributes: {"style": ["p"]}}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div><span>hello</span></div>

new Sanitizer({allowAttributes: {"style": ["*"]}}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div><span style="color: red">hello</span></div>

new Sanitizer({dropAttributes: {"id": ["span"]}}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div><span class="bar" style="color: red">hello</span></div>

new Sanitizer({allowAttributes: {}}).sanitizeFor("div", str)
// <div>hello</div>
```

**`allowCustomElements`** is the option to allow or deny custom elements. If they're allowed, other configurations for elements and attributes still apply.


```js
const str = `<custom-elem>hello</custom-elem>`

new Sanitizer().sanitizeFor("div", str);
// <div></div>

new Sanitizer({ allowCustomElements: true,
                allowElements: ["div", "custom-elem"]
              }).sanitizeFor("div", str);
// <div><custom-elem>hello</custom-elem></div>
```

{% Aside %}
The Sanitizer API is designed to be safe by default. This means that no matter how you set it up, it will never allow constructs that are known XXS targets. For example, `allowElements: ["script"]` won't actually allow `<script>`, because the built-in baseline configuration cannot be overridden. The purpose of customization is to override default settings if your application has special needs.
{% endAside %}


## API Surface

It may be illustrative to compare the Sanitizer API to [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify), a well-known library that offers sanitization functionality: The main difference is that DOMPurify may returns the result of the sanitization as a string, which you need to expand into a DOM via `.innerHTML`.


```js
const user_input = `<em>hello world</em><img src="" onerror=alert(0)>`
const sanitized = DOMPurify.sanitize(user_input)
$div.innerHTML = sanitized
// `<em>hello world</em><img src="">`
```

This can be an alternative when the Sanitizer API is not implemented on the browser.

This has two consequences: If a string is returned, then the input string is parsed twice, by DOMPurify and `.innerHTML`. This double parsing wastes processing time, but can also lead to interesting vulnerabilities caused by cases where the result of the second parsing is different from the first.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Details of vulnerabilities can be found below.

[Mutation XSS via namespace confusion - DOMPurify < 2.0.17 bypass - research.securitum.com](https://research.securitum.com/mutation-xss-via-mathml-mutation-dompurify-2-0-17-bypass/)
{% endAside %}

HTML also needs **context** to be parsed. For example, `<td>` makes sense in `<table>`, but not in `<div>`. Since `DOMPurify.sanitize()` only takes a string as an argument, the parsing context had to be guessed.

(A detailed explanation is in the [Explainer](https://github.com/otherdaniel/purification/blob/strings-explainer/explainer-strings.md))

The [Sanitizer API](https://wicg.github.io/sanitizer-api/) has learned from the DOMPurify experience and is designed to eliminate the need for double parsing and to clarify the parsing context as follows.

## How to enable the Sanitizer API


### Enabling via about://flags or CLI option


#### Chrome

Chrome is in the process of implementing the Sanitizer API, and when Chrome 93 is released, you can try out the behavior by enabling `about://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`. In earlier versions of the Canary/Dev channel, you can enable it via `--enable-blink-features=SanitizerAPI` and try it out for yourself right now. More details about using a flag can be found [here](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags).


#### Firefox

Firefox also implements the Sanitizer API. You can set the `dom.security.sanitizer.enabled` flag to `true` in `about:config` and it works as experimental.

### Feature detection

```js
if (window.Sanitizer) {
  // Sanitizer API is enabled
}
```

### Feedback

If you try this API and have some feedback, we'd love to hear it. GitHub issue is a best place to share your thoughts and discuss with folks interested in this API and spec authors.

### Browser compatibility

The Sanitizer API is under discussion in the standardization process. The implementation status of other browsers is as follows

Mozilla: considers this proposal as [worth prototyping](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/#sanitizer-api), and they are [actively implementing](https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.platform/c/C4EHeQlaMbU).

Webkit: see the response on [webkit mailing lists](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2021-March/031731.html).
