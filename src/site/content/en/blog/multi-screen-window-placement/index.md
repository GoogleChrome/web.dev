{% Aside %}
  The Multi-Screen Window Placement API is part of the
  [capabilities project](https://web.dev/fugu-status/) and is currently in
  development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses.
{% endAside %}

The Multi-Screen Window Placement API allows you to enumerate the
displays connected to your machine and to place windows on specific screens.

### Suggested use cases {: #use-cases }

Examples of sites that may use this API include:

- Multi-window graphics editors à la
  [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/release-notes/gimp-2.8.html#single-window-mode) can place various
  editing tools in accurately positioned windows.
- Virtual trading desks can show market trends in multiple windows any of which can be viewed in
  fullscreen mode.
- Slideshow apps can show speaker notes on the internal primary screen and the presentation on an
  external projector.

## How to use the Multi-Screen Window Placement API {: #use }

### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with the Multi-Screen Window Placement API locally, without an origin trial token,
enable the `#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` flag in `chrome://flags`.

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

Starting in Chrome&nbsp;86, the Multi-Screen Window Placement API will be available as an origin
trial in Chrome. The origin trial is expected to end in Chrome&nbsp;88 (February&nbsp;24, 2021).

### The problem

The time-tested approach to controlling windows,
[`Window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open),
is unfortunately unaware of additional screens.
While some aspects of this API seem a little archaic, such as its
[`windowFeatures`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#Parameters:~:text=title.-,windowFeatures)
`DOMString` parameter, it has nevertheless served us well over the years. To specify a window's
[position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#Position), you can pass the
coordinates as `left` and `top` (or `screenX` and `screenY` respectively) and pass the desired
[size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#Size:~:text=well.-,Size) as
`width` and `height` (or `innerWidth` and `innerHeight` respectively). For example, to open a
400×300 window at 50 pixels from the left and 50 pixels from the top, this is the code that you
could use:

```js
const popup = window.open(
  "https://example.com/",
  "My Popup",
  "left=50,top=50,width=400,height=300"
);
```

You can get information about the current screen by looking at the
[`window.screen`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/screen) property, which
returns a [`Screen`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen) object. This is the
output on my MacBook Air 13″:

```js
window.screen;
/* Output from my MacBook Air 13″:
  availHeight: 975
  availLeft: 0
  availTop: 23
  availWidth: 1680
  colorDepth: 30
  height: 1050
  id: ""
  internal: false
  left: 0
  orientation: ScreenOrientation {angle: 0, type: "landscape-primary", onchange: null}
  pixelDepth: 30
  primary: false
  scaleFactor: 2
  top: 0
  touchSupport: false
  width: 1680
*/
```

Like most people working in tech, I have had to adapt myself to the new work reality and set up
my personal home office. Mine looks like on the photo below (if you are interested, you can read the
[full details about my setup](https://blog.tomayac.com/2020/03/23/my-working-from-home-setup-during-covid-19/)).
The iPad next to my MacBook Air is connected to the laptop via
[Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380), so whenever I need to, I can quickly turn the
iPad into a second screen.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./desk.jpg" alt="School bench on two chairs. On top of the school bench are shoe boxes supporting a laptop and two iPads surrounding it.">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">A multi-screen setup.</figcaption>
</figure>

If I want to take advantage of the bigger screen, I can put the popup from the
[code sample](/multi-screen-window-placement/#the-problem) above on to the
second screen. I do it like this:

```js
popup.moveTo(2500, 50);
```

This is a rough guess, since there is no way to know the dimensions of the second
screen. The info from `window.screen` only covers the built-in screen, but not the iPad screen.
The reported `width` of the built-in screen was `1680` pixels, so moving to
`2500` pixels *might* work to shift the window over to the iPad, since _I_ happen to know that it is
located on the right of my MacBook Air. How can I do this in the general case? Turns out, there is a
better way than guessing. That way is the Multi-Screen Window Placement API.

### Feature detection

To check if the Multi-Screen Window Placement API is supported, use:

```js
if ("getScreens" in window) {
  // The Multi-Screen Window Placement API is supported.
}
```

### The `window-placement` permission

Before I can use the Multi-Screen Window Placement API, I must ask the user for permission to do so.
The new `window-placement` permission can be queried with the
[Permissions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API) like so:

```js
let granted = false;
try {
  const { state } = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: "window-placement" });
  granted = state === "granted";
} catch {
  // Nothing.
}
```

The browser
[can](https://webscreens.github.io/window-placement/#issue-c601b517:~:text=Permission%20check%20for%20above%3F,-partial)
choose to show the permission prompt dynamically upon the first attempt to use any
of the methods of the new API.
Read on to learn more.

### The `isMultiScreen()` method

To use the the Multi-Screen Window Placement API, I will first call the
`Window.isMultiScreen()` method. It returns a promise that resolves with either `true` or `false`,
depending on whether one or multiple screens are currently connected to the machine. For my setup,
it returns `true`.

```js
await window.isMultiScreen();
// Returns `true` or `false`.
```

### The `getScreens()` method

Now that I know that the current setup is multi-screen, I can obtain more
information about the second screen using `Window.getScreens()`. It returns a promise
that resolves with an array of `Screen` objects. On my MacBook Air 13 with a connected iPad, this
returns an array of two `Screen` objects:

```js
await window.getScreens();
/* Output from my MacBook Air 13″ with the iPad attached:
  Screen 1 (built-in display):
  availHeight: 975
  availLeft: 0
  availTop: 23
  availWidth: 1680
  colorDepth: 30
  height: 1050
  id: "0"
  internal: true
  left: 0
  orientation: null
  pixelDepth: 30
  primary: true
  scaleFactor: 2
  top: 0
  touchSupport: false
  width: 1680

  Screen 2 (iPad):
  availHeight: 1001
  availLeft: 1680
  availTop: 23
  availWidth: 1366
  colorDepth: 24
  height: 1024
  id: "1"
  internal: false
  left: 1680
  orientation: null
  pixelDepth: 24
  primary: false
  scaleFactor: 2
  top: 0
  touchSupport: false
  width: 1366
*/
```

Note how the value of `left` for the iPad starts at `1680`, which is exactly the `width` of the
built-in display. This allows me to determine exactly how the screens are arranged logically (next
to each other, on top of each other, etc.). There is also data now for each screen to show whether
it is an `internal` one and whether it is a `primary` one.
Note that the built-in screen
[is not necessarily the primary screen](https://osxdaily.com/2010/04/27/set-the-primary-display-mac/#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20Display%20icon,primary%20display%20for%20your%20Mac).
Both also have an `id`, which, if
persisted across browser sessions, allows for window arrangements to be restored.

### The `screenschange` event

The only thing missing now is a way to detect when my screen setup changes. A new event,
`screenschange`, does exactly that: it fires whenever the screen constellation
is modified.
(Notice that "screens" is plural in the event name.)
It also fires when the resolution of one of the connected screens changes or when a
new or an existing screen is (physically or virtually in the case of Sidecar) plugged in or unplugged.

Note that you need to look up the new screen details asynchronously, the `screenschange` event
itself does not provide this data. This may [change in the
future](https://github.com/webscreens/window-placement/issues/28). For now you
can look up the screen details by calling `window.getScreens()` as shown below.

```js
window.addEventListener('screenschange', async (event) => {
  console.log('I am there, but mostly useless', event);
  const details = await window.getScreens();
});
```

### New fullscreen options

Until now, you could request that elements be displayed in fullscreen mode via the aptly named
[`requestFullScreen()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/requestFullscreen)
method. The method takes an `options` parameter where you can pass
[`FullscreenOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FullscreenOptions). So far, its only property has been
[`navigationUI`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FullscreenOptions/navigationUI).
The Multi-Screen Window Placement API adds a new `screen` property that allows you to determine
which screen to start the fullscreen view on. For example, if you want to make the primary screen fullscreen:

```js
try {
  const primaryScreen = (await getScreens()).filter((screen) => screen.primary)[0];
  await document.body.requestFullscreen({ screen: primaryScreen });
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err.name, err.message);
}
```

### Polyfill

It is not possible to polyfill the Multi-Screen Window Placement API, but you
can shim its shape so you can code exclusively against the new API:

```js
if (!("getScreens" in window)) {
  // Returning a one-element array with the current screen,
  // noting that there might be more.
  window.getScreens = async () => [window.screen];
  // Returning `false`, noting that this might be a lie.
  window.isMultiScreen = async () => false;
}
```

The other aspects of the API—the `onscreenschange` event and the `screen` property of the
`FullscreenOptions`—would simply never fire or silently be ignored respectively by non-supporting
browsers.

## Demo

If you are anything like me, you keep a close eye on the development of the various cryptocurrencies.
(In reality I very much do not, but, for the sake of this article, just assume I do.) To
keep track of the cryptocurrencies that I own, I have developed a web app that allows me to watch
the markets in all life situations, such as from the comfort of my bed, where I have a decent
single-screen setup.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./tv.jpg" alt="Massive TV screen at the end of a bed with the author's legs partly visible. On the screen, a fake crypto currency trading desk. ">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Relaxing and watching the markets.</figcaption>
</figure>

This being about crypto, the markets can get hectic at any time. Should this happen, I can quickly
move over to my desk where I have a multi-screen setup. I can click on any currency's window
and quickly see the full details in a fullscreen view on the opposite screen. Below is a recent
photo of me taken during the last [YCY bloodbath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
It caught me completely off-guard and left me
[with my hands on my face](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/gavon/brokers-with-hands-on-their-faces).

## Security and permissions

The Chrome team has designed and implemented the Multi-Screen Window Placement API using the core
principles defined in [Controlling Access to Powerful Web Platform Features][powerful-apis],
including user control, transparency, and ergonomics. The Multi-Screen Window Placement API exposes
new information about the screens connected to a device, increasing the fingerprinting surface of
users, especially those with multiple screens consistently connected to their devices. As one
mitigation of this privacy concern, the exposed screen properties are limited to the minimum needed
for common placement use cases. User permission is required for sites to get multi-screen
information and place windows on other screens.

### User control

The user is in full control of the exposure of their setup. They can accept or decline the
permission prompt, and revoke a previously granted permission via the site information feature in
the browser.

### Transparency

The fact whether the permission to use the Multi-Screen Window Placement API has been granted is
exposed in the browser's site information and is also queryable via the Permissions API.

### Permission persistence

The browser persists permission grants. The permission can be revoked via the browser's site
information.
