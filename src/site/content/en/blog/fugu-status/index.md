The [capabilities project][capabilities-project] is a cross-company effort at Google
to make it possible for web apps to do anything native apps can, by exposing the
capabilities of native platforms to the web platform, while maintaining user
security, privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.

You can see the full list of new and potential capabilities at
the [Fugu API Tracker](https://goo.gle/fugu-api-tracker).

## Capabilities available behind a flag {: #flag }

These APIs are only available behind a flag. They're experimental and still
under development. They are not ready for use in production. There's a good
chance there are bugs, that these APIs will break, or the API surface will
change.<a name="shape-face-text"></a>

        <td>
          Shape detection opens up native
          implementations of shape detection services and exposes them through
          a set of JavaScript interfaces. In additon to the APIs below, the
          Barcode Detection API is available in stable. For more information,

          Notification Triggers let you schedule notifications in advance, so
          that the operating system will deliver the notification at the right
          time - even if there is no network connectivity, or the device is in
          battery saver mode.<br>

## Capabilities available as an origin trial {: #origin-trial }

These APIs are available as an [origin trial][ot-dashboard] in Chrome. Origin
trials provide an opportunity for Chrome to validate experimental features and
APIs, and make it possible for you to provide feedback on their usability
and effectiveness in broader deployment.

Opting into an origin trial allows you to build demos and prototypes that
your beta testing users can try for the duration of the trial without requiring
them to flip any special flags in their browser. There's more info on origin
trials in the [Origin Trials Guide for Web Developers][ot-guide].

<div class="w-table-wrapper">

          <a href="/content-indexing-api/">Content Indexing API</a>
        </td>
        <td>
          Your PWA might cache articles and media files, but how will your users
          know that your pages work while offline? The Content Indexing API is
          one answer to this question currently in an origin trial. Once the
          index is populated with content from your PWA, as well as any other
          installed PWAs, it will show up in dedicated areas of supported
          browsers.<br>

        <td>
          The Idle Detection API notifies developers when a user is idle,
          indicating such things as lack of interaction with the keyboard,
          mouse, screen, activation of a screensaver, locking of the screen, or
          moving to a different screen. A developer-defined threshold triggers
          the notification.<br>

            Serial API
          </a>
        </td>
        <td>
          The Serial API provides a way for websites to read from and
          write to a serial device with scripts. The API bridges the web and
          the physical world by allowing websites to communicate with serial
          devices, such as microcontrollers and 3D printers.<br>

        <td>
          Web NFC provides sites the ability to read and write to NFC tags when
          they are in close proximity to the user's device.
          For example, museums and art galleries could display additional
          information about a display when the user touches their device to an
          NFC card near the exhibit; or an inventory management web app could
          read or write data to an NFC tag on a container to update information
          on its contents.<br>

## Capabilities available in stable {: #in-stable }

The following APIs have graduated from origin trial and are available in the
latest version of Chrome, and in many cases other Chromium based browsers.

        <td>
          <a href="/wakelock/">Wake Lock API</a>
        </td>
        <td>
          To avoid draining the battery, most devices will quickly fall asleep
          when left idle. While this is fine most of the time, there are
          some applications that need to keep the screen or the device awake in
          order to complete some work. The Wake Lock API provides a way to
          prevent the device from dimming or locking the screen or prevent
          the device from going to sleep when an application needs to keep
          running.<br>

          <a href="/badging-api/">Badging API</a>
        </td>
        <td>
          The Badging API allows web apps to set an application-wide badge,
          shown in an operating-system-specific place associated with the
          application, such as the shelf or home screen. Badging makes it easy
          to subtly notify the user that there is some new activity that might
          require their attention, or it can be used to indicate a small
          amount of information, such as an unread count.<br/>
          <div class="w-aside w-aside--note">
          Despite a stable version of the spec shipping in Chrome 81, an origin
          trial is running in Chrome 79 and Chrome 81 until September 15, 2020.

        <td>
          The Asynchronous Clipboard API makes it possible to read and write

        <td>
          The Contact Picker API is an on-demand picker that allows users to
          select entries from their contact list and share limited details of
          the selected entries with a website. It allows users to share only
          what they want, when they want, and makes it easier for users to
          reach and connect with their friends and family.<br>

        </td>
        <td>
          The Get Installed Related Apps API is a web platform API
          that allows your web app to check to see if your native app is
          installed on the users device, and vice versa.<br>

        </td>
        <td>
          The Native File System API (formerly known as the Writable Files API)
          enables developers to build powerful web apps that interact with files
          on the user's local device, like IDEs, photo and video editors, text
          editors, and more. After a user grants a web app access, this API
          allows web apps to read or save changes directly to files and folders
          on the user's device.<br>

        </td>
        <td>
          Periodic Background Sync enables web applications to periodically
          synchronize data in the background, bringing web apps closer to
          the behavior of a native app.<br>

        <td>
          Shape detection opens up native
          implementations of shape detection services and exposes them through
          a set of JavaScript interfaces. Shape detection has three separate
          APIs, of which the Barcode API is only one. See

          Finding, memorizing, and typing OTPs sent via SMS is cumbersome.
          The Web OTP API (formerly the SMS Receiver API) simplifies the OTP
          workflow for users.<br>

        <td>
          With the Web Share API, web apps are able to use the same
          system-provided share capabilities as native apps. The Web Share API
          makes it possible for web apps to share links, text, and files to
          other apps installed on the device in the same way as native apps.<br>

          The Web Share Target API allows installed web apps to register with

          either the Web Share API or system events, like the OS-level share
          button.<br>
