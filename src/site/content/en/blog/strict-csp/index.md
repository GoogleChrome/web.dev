## Why should you deploy a strict Content Security Policy (CSP)?

[Cross-site scripting
(XSS)](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/)‚Äîthe ability to
inject malicious scripts into a web application‚Äîhas been one of the biggest web
security vulnerabilities for over a decade.

[Content Security Policy
(CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is an added layer
of security that helps to mitigate XSS. Configuring a CSP involves adding the
Content-Security-Policy HTTP header to a web page and setting values to control
what resources the user agent is allowed to load for that page. This article
explains how to use a CSP based on nonces or hashes to mitigate XSS instead of
the commonly used host-allowlist-based CSPs which often leave the page exposed
to XSS as they can be [bypassed in most
configurations](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45542.html).

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
A _nonce_ is a random number used only once that can be
used to mark a `<script>` tag as trusted.
{% endAside %}

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
A hash function is a mathematical function that converts
an input value into a compressed numerical value‚Äîa hash. A _hash_ (such as
[SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)) can be used to mark an inline
`<script>` tag as trusted.
{% endAside %}

A Content Security Policy based on nonces or hashes is often called a *strict
CSP*. When an application uses a strict CSP, attackers who find HTML injection
flaws will generally not be able to use them to force the browser to execute
malicious scripts in the context of the vulnerable document. This is because
strict CSP only permits hashed scripts or scripts with the correct nonce value
generated on the server, so attackers cannot execute the script without knowing
the correct nonce for a given response.


{% Aside %}
To protect your site from XSS, make sure to sanitize user input
*and* use CSP as an extra security layer. CSP is a
[defense-in-depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing))
technique that can prevent the execution of malicious scripts, but it's not a
substitute for avoiding (and promptly fixing) XSS bugs.
{% endAside %}

### Why a strict CSP is recommended over allowlist CSPs

If your site already has a CSP that looks like this: `script-src
www.googleapis.com`, it may not be effective against cross-site scripting! This
type of CSP is called an allowlist CSP and it has a couple of downsides:
 - It requires a lot of customization.
 - It can be [bypassed in most
   configurations](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45542.html).

This makes allowlist CSPs generally ineffective at preventing attackers from
exploiting XSS. That's why it's recommended to use a strict CSP based on
cryptographic nonces or hashes, which avoids the pitfalls outlined above.

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'worse', 'Allowlist CSP' %}
- Doesn't effectively protect your site. ‚ùå
- Must be highly customized. üòì
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Strict CSP' %}
- Effectively protects your site. ‚úÖ
- Always has the same structure. üòå
{% endCompare %}
</div>


## What is a strict Content Security Policy?

A strict Content Security Policy has the following structure and is enabled by
setting one of the following HTTP response headers:
- **Nonce-based strict CSP**
```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  script-src 'nonce-{RANDOM}' 'strict-dynamic';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'none';

```

{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/er4BaGCJzBwDaESFKfZd.jpg",
alt="", width="800", height="279" %}


- **Hash-based strict CSP**
```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  script-src 'sha256-{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT}' 'strict-dynamic';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'none';

```

{% Aside warning %}
This is the most stripped-down version of a strict CSP.
You'll need to tweak it to make it effective across browsers. See [add a
fallback to support Safari and older
browsers](#step-4:-add-fallbacks-to-support-safari-and-older-browsers) for
details.
{% endAside %}


The following properties make a CSP like the one above "strict" and hence
secure:
- Uses nonces `'nonce-{RANDOM}'` or hashes `'sha256-{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT}'` to
  indicate which `<script>` tags are trusted by the site's developer and should
  be allowed to execute in the user's browser.
- Sets [`'strict-dynamic'`](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#strict-dynamic-usage) to
  reduce the effort of deploying a nonce- or hash-based CSP by automatically
  allowing the execution of scripts that are created by an already trusted
  script. This also unblocks the use of most third party JavaScript libraries
  and widgets.
- Not based on URL allowlists and therefore doesn't suffer from [common CSP
  bypasses](https://speakerdeck.com/lweichselbaum/csp-is-dead-long-live-strict-csp-deepsec-2016?slide=15).

- Blocks untrusted inline scripts like inline event handlers or `javascript:`
  URIs.
- Restricts `object-src` to disable dangerous plugins such as Flash.
- Restricts `base-uri` to block the injection of `<base>` tags. This prevents
  attackers from changing the locations of scripts loaded from relative URLs.


{% Aside %} Another advantage of a strict CSP is that the CSP always has the
same structure and doesn't need to be customized for your application. {%
endAside %}


## Adopting a strict CSP

To adopt a strict CSP, you need to:
1. Decide if your application should set a nonce- or hash-based CSP.
1. Copy the CSP from the [What is a strict Content Security
   Policy](#what-is-a-strict-content-security-policy) section and set it as a
   response header across your application.
1. Refactor HTML templates and client-side code to remove patterns that are
   incompatible with CSP.
1. Add fallbacks to support Safari and older browsers.
1. Deploy your CSP.

You can use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
(v7.3.0 and above with flag `--preset=experimental`) **Best Practices** audit throughout this process to check
whether your site has a CSP, and whether it's strict enough to be effective
against XSS.

{% Img src="image/9B7J9oWjgsWbuE84mmxDaY37Wpw2/42a4iEEKsD4T3yU47vNQ.png",
alt="Lighthouse report warning that no CSP is found in enforcement mode.",
width="730", height="78", class="w-screenshot" %}

### Step 1: Decide if you need a nonce- or hash-based CSP

There are two types of strict CSPs, nonce- and hash-based. Here's how they work:
- **Nonce-based CSP**: You generate a random number *at runtime*, include it in
  your CSP, and associate it with every script tag in your page. An attacker
  can't include and run a malicious script in your page, because they would need
  to guess the correct random number for that script. This only works if the
  number is not guessable and newly generated at runtime for every response.
- **Hash-based CSP**: The hash of every inline script tag is added to the CSP.
  Note that each script has a different hash. An attacker can't include and run
  a malicious script in your page, because the hash of that script would need to
  be present in your CSP.

Criteria for choosing a strict CSP approach:

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
      <caption>Criteria for choosing a strict CSP approach</caption>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Nonce-based CSP</th>
        <td>For HTML pages rendered on the server where you can create a new random token
(nonce) for every response.</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Hash-based CSP</th>
        <td>For HTML pages served statically or those that need to be cached. For example,
single-page web applications built with frameworks such as Angular, React or others, that are
statically served without server-side rendering.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>



### Step 2: Set a strict CSP and prepare your scripts


When setting a CSP, you have a few options:
- Report-only mode (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) or enforcement mode
  (`Content-Security-Policy`). In report-only, the CSP won't block resources
  yet‚Äînothing will break‚Äîbut you'll be able to see errors and receive reports
  for what would have been blocked. Locally, when you're in the process of
  setting a CSP, this doesn't really matter, because both modes will show you
  the errors in the browser console. If anything, enforcement mode will make it
  even easier for you to see blocked resources and tweak your CSP, since your
  page will look broken. Report-only mode becomes most useful later in the
  process (see [Step 5](#step-5:-deploy-your-csp)).
- Header or HTML `<meta>` tag. For local development, a `<meta>` tag may be more
  convenient for tweaking your CSP and quickly seeing how it affects your site.
  However:
  - Later on, when deploying your CSP in production, it is recommended to set it
    as an HTTP header.
  - If you want to set your CSP in report-only mode, you'll need to set it as a
    header‚ÄîCSP meta tags don't support report-only mode.


{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %} Option A: Nonce-based CSP {% endDetailsSummary %}

Set the following `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP response header in your
application:
```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  script-src 'nonce-{RANDOM}' 'strict-dynamic';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'none';
```

{% Aside 'caution' %}

Replace the `{RANDOM}` placeholder with a *random* nonce that is regenerated
**on every server response**. {% endAside %}

#### Generate a nonce for CSP

A nonce is a random number used only once per page load. A nonce-based CSP can
only mitigate XSS if the nonce value is **not guessable** by an attacker. A
nonce for CSP needs to be:
- A cryptographically **strong random** value (ideally 128+ bits in length)
- Newly **generated for every response**
- Base64 encoded

Here are some examples on how to add a CSP nonce in server-side frameworks:
- [Django (python)](https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nonce.html)
- Express (JavaScript):

```javascript
const app = express();
app.get('/', function(request, response) {
    // Generate a new random nonce value for every response.
    const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString("base64");
    // Set the strict nonce-based CSP response header
    const csp = `script-src 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic' https:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';`;
    response.set("Content-Security-Policy", csp);
    // Every <script> tag in your application should set the `nonce` attribute to this value.
    response.render(template, { nonce: nonce });
  });
}
```

#### Add a `nonce` attribute to `<script>` elements

With a nonce-based CSP, every `<script>` element must have a `nonce` attribute
which matches the random nonce value specified in the CSP header (all scripts
can have the same nonce). The first step is to add these attributes to all
scripts:

{% Compare 'worse', 'Blocked by CSP'%}
```html
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
<script>foo()</script>
```
{% CompareCaption %}
CSP will block these scripts, because they don't have
`nonce` attributes.
{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Allowed by CSP' %}
```html
<script nonce="${NONCE}" src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
<script nonce="${NONCE}">foo()</script>
```
{% CompareCaption %}
CSP will allow the execution of these scripts if `${NONCE}`
is replaced with a value matching the nonce in the CSP response header. Note
that some browsers will hide the `nonce` attribute when inspecting the page
source.
{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
With `'strict-dynamic'` in your CSP, you'll only have to
add nonces to `<script>` tags that are present in the initial HTML
response.`'strict-dynamic'` allows the execution of scripts dynamically added to
the page, as long as they were loaded by a safe, already-trusted script (see the
[specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#strict-dynamic-usage)).
{% endAside %}

{% endDetails %}

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
Option B: Hash-based CSP Response Header
{% endDetailsSummary %}

Set the following `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP response header in your
application:

```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  script-src 'sha256-{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT}' 'strict-dynamic';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'none';
```

For several inline scripts, the syntax is as follows:
`'sha256-{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT_1}'  'sha256-{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT_2}'`.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
The `{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT}` placeholder must be replaced
with a base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of an inline script that can be used to load
other scripts (see next section). You can calculate SHA hashes of static inline
`<script>` blocks with this
[tool](https://strict-csp-codelab.glitch.me/csp_sha256_util.html). An
alternative is to inspect the CSP violation warnings in Chrome's developer
console, which contains hashes of blocked scripts, and add these hashes to the
policy as 'sha256-‚Ä¶'.

A script injected by an attacker will be blocked by the browser as only the
hashed inline script and any scripts dynamically added by it will be allowed to
execute by the browser.
{% endAside %}

#### Load sourced scripts dynamically

All scripts that are externally sourced need to be loaded dynamically via an
inline script, because CSP hashes are supported across browsers only for inline
scripts (hashes for sourced scripts are [not well-supported across
browsers](https://wpt.fyi/results/content-security-policy/script-src/script-src-sri_hash.sub.html?label=master&label=experimental&aligned)).


{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/B2YsfJDYw8PRI6kJI7Bs.jpg",
alt="", width="800", height="333" %}

{% Compare 'worse', 'Blocked by CSP' %}
```html
<script src="https://example.org/foo.js"></script>
<script src="https://example.org/bar.js"></script>
```
{% CompareCaption %}
CSP will block these scripts since only inline-scripts can
be hashed.
{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Allowed by CSP' %}
```html
<script>
var scripts = [ 'https://example.org/foo.js', 'https://example.org/bar.js'];
scripts.forEach(function(scriptUrl) {
  var s = document.createElement('script');
  s.src = scriptUrl;
  s.async = false; // to preserve execution order
  document.head.appendChild(s);
});
</script>
```
{% CompareCaption %}
To allow execution of this script, the hash of the inline
script must be calculated and added to the CSP response header, replacing the
`{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT}` placeholder. To reduce the amount of hashes, you can
optionally merge all inline scripts into a single script. To see this in action
checkout the [example](https://strict-csp-codelab.glitch.me/solution_hash_csp#)
and examine the
[code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/strict-csp-codelab?path=demo%2Fsolution_hash_csp.html%3A1%3A).
{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
When calculating a CSP hash for inline scripts, whitespace
characters between the opening and closing `<script>` tags matter. You can
calculate CSP hashes for inline scripts using this
[tool](https://strict-csp-codelab.glitch.me/csp_sha256_util.html).
{% endAside %}

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
About `async = false` and script loading `async = false`
isn't blocking in this case, but use this with care.
{% endDetailsSummary %}

In the code snippet above, `s.async = false` is added to ensure that foo
executes before bar (even if bar loads first). **In this snippet, `s.async =
false` does not block the parser while the scripts load**; that's because the
scripts are added dynamically. The parser will only stop as the scripts are
being executed, just like it would behave for `async` scripts. However, with
this snippet, keep in mind:
 - One/both scripts may execute before the document has finished downloading. If
   you want the document to be ready by the time the scripts execute, you need
   to wait for the [`DOMContentLoaded`
   event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event)
   before you append the scripts. If this causes a performance issue (because
   the scripts don't start downloading early enough), you can use [preload
   tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content)
   earlier in the page.
 - `defer = true` won't do anything. If you need that behaviour, you'll have to
   manually run the script at the time you want to run it. {% endDetails %}

{% endDetails %}

### Step 3:  Refactor HTML templates and client-side code to remove patterns incompatible with CSP

Inline event handlers (such as `onclick="‚Ä¶"`, `onerror="‚Ä¶"`) and JavaScript URIs
(`<a href="javascript:‚Ä¶">`) can be used to run scripts. This means that an
attacker who finds an XSS bug could inject this kind of HTML and execute
malicious JavaScript. A nonce- or hash-based CSP disallows the use of such
markup. If your site makes use of any of the patterns described above, you'll
need to refactor them into safer alternatives.

If you enabled CSP in the previous step, you'll be able to see CSP violations in
the console every time CSP blocks an incompatible pattern.

{% Img src="image/vgdbNJBYHma2o62ZqYmcnkq3j0o1/mRWfNxAhQXzInOLCgtv8.jpg",
alt="CSP violation reports in the Chrome developer console.",
class="w-screenshot", width="800", height="235" %}

In most cases, the fix is straightforward:

#### To refactor inline event handlers, rewrite them to be added from a JavaScript block

{% Compare 'worse', 'Blocked by CSP' %}
```html
<span onclick="doThings();">A thing.</span>
```
{% CompareCaption %}
CSP will block inline event handlers.
{% endCompareCaption%}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Allowed by CSP' %}
```html
<span id="things">A thing.</span>
<script nonce="${nonce}">
  document.getElementById('things')
          .addEventListener('click', doThings);
</script>
```

{% CompareCaption %}
CSP will allow event handlers that are registered via JavaScript.
{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

#### For `javascript:` URIs, you can use a similar pattern

{% Compare 'worse', 'Blocked by CSP' %}
```html
<a href="javascript:linkClicked()">foo</a>
```
{% CompareCaption %}
CSP will block javascript: URIs.
{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'Allowed by CSP' %}
```html
<a id="foo">foo</a>
<script nonce="${nonce}">
  document.getElementById('foo')
          .addEventListener('click', linkClicked);
</script>
```

{% CompareCaption %}
CSP will allow event handlers that are registered via JavaScript.
{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

#### Use of `eval()` in JavaScript

If your application uses `eval()` to convert JSON string serializations into JS
objects, you should refactor such instances to `JSON.parse()`, which is also
[faster](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#json).

If you cannot remove all uses of `eval()`, you can still set a strict
nonce-based CSP, but you will have to use the `'unsafe-eval'` CSP keyword which
will make your policy slightly less secure.

You can find these and more examples of such refactoring in this strict CSP
Codelab:
{% Glitch {
  id: 'strict-csp-codelab',
  path: 'demo/solution_nonce_csp.html',
  highlights: '14,20,28,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,54,55,56,57,58,59,60',
  previewSize: 35,
  allow: []
} %}

### Step 4:  Add fallbacks to support Safari and older browsers

CSP is supported by all major browsers, but you'll need two fallbacks:
- Using `'strict-dynamic'` requires adding `https:` as a fallback for Safari,
  the only major browser without support for `'strict-dynamic'`. By doing so:
  - All browsers that support `'strict-dynamic'` will ignore the `https:`
    fallback, so this won't reduce the strength of the policy.
  -  In Safari, externally sourced scripts will be allowed to load only if they
     come from an HTTPS origin. This is less secure than a strict CSP‚Äìit's a
     fallback‚Äìbut would still prevent certain common XSS causes like injections
     of `javascript:` URIs because `'unsafe-inline'` is not present or ignored
     in presence of a hash or nonce.

- To ensure compatibility with very old browser versions (4+ years), you can add
  `'unsafe-inline'` as a fallback. All recent browsers will ignore
  `'unsafe-inline'` if a CSP nonce or hash is present.

```text
Content-Security-Policy:
  script-src 'nonce-{random}' 'strict-dynamic' https: 'unsafe-inline';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'none';
```
{% Aside %}
`https:` and `unsafe-inline` don't make your policy less safe
because they will be ignored by browsers which support `strict-dynamic`.
{% endAside %}

### Step 5:  Deploy your CSP

After confirming that no legitimate scripts are being blocked by CSP in your
local development environment, you can proceed with deploying your CSP to your
(staging, then) production environment:
1. (Optional) Deploy your CSP in report-only mode using the
   `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header. Learn more about the [Reporting
   API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/reportingapi).
   Report-only mode is handy to test a potentially breaking change like a new
   CSP in production, before actually enforcing CSP restrictions. In report-only
   mode, your CSP does not affect the behavior of your application (nothing will
   actually break). But the browser will still generate console errors and
   violation reports when patterns incompatible with CSP are encountered (so you
   can see what would have broken for your end-users).
1. Once you're confident that your CSP won't induce breakage for your end-users,
   deploy your CSP using the `Content-Security-Policy` response header. **Only
   once you've completed this step, will CSP begin to protect your application
   from XSS**. Setting your CSP via a HTTP header server-side is more secure
   than setting it as a `<meta>` tag; use a header if you can.


{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
Make sure that the CSP you're using is "strict" by
checking it with the [CSP Evaluator](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com) or
Lighthouse. This is very important, as even small changes to a policy can
significantly reduce its security.
{% endAside %}

{% Aside 'caution' %}
When enabling CSP for production traffic, you may see some
noise in the CSP violation reports due to browser extensions and malware.
{% endAside %}

## Limitations

Generally speaking, a strict CSP provides a strong added layer of security that
helps to mitigate XSS. In most cases, CSP reduces the attack surface
significantly (dangerous patterns like `javascript:` URIs are completely turned
off). However, based on the type of CSP you're using (nonces, hashes, with or
without `'strict-dynamic'`), there are cases where CSP doesn't protect:
- If you nonce a script, but there's an injection directly into the body or into
  the `src` parameter of that `<script>` element.
- If there are injections into the locations of dynamically created scripts
  (`document.createElement('script')`), including into any library functions
  which create `script` DOM nodes based on the value of their arguments. This
  includes some common APIs such as jQuery's `.html()`, as well as `.get()` and
  `.post()` in jQuery < 3.0.
- If there are template injections in old AngularJS applications. An attacker
  who can inject an AngularJS template can use it to [execute arbitrary
  JavaScript](https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/angularjs-expression-sandbox-bypass).
- If the policy contains `'unsafe-eval'`, injections into `eval()`,
  `setTimeout()` and a few other rarely used APIs.

Developers and security engineers should pay particular attention to such
patterns during code reviews and security audits. You can find more details on
the cases described above in [this CSP
presentation](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/locomocosec2019/db/CSP%20-%20A%20Successful%20Mess%20Between%20Hardening%20and%20Mitigation%20%281%29.pdf#page=27).

protect against some of the limitations listed above. Learn more about [how to
use Trusted Types at web.dev](/trusted-types).
