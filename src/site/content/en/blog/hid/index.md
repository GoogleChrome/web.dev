{% Aside %}
The WebHID API is part of the [Capabilities project](/fugu-status/) and is
currently in development. This post will be updated as the implementation
progresses.
{% endAside %}

There is a long tail of human interface devices (HIDs), such as alternative
keyboards or exotic gamepads, that are too new, too old, or too uncommon to be
accessible by systems' device drivers. The WebHID API solves this by providing a
way to implement device-specific logic in JavaScript.

## Suggested use cases {: #use-cases }

A HID device takes input from or provides output to humans. Examples of devices
include keyboards, pointing devices (mice, touchscreens, etc.), and gamepads.
The [HID protocol] makes it possible to access these devices on desktop
computers using operating system drivers. The web platform supports HID devices
by relying on these drivers.

The inability to access uncommon HID devices is particularly painful when it
comes to alternative auxiliary keyboards (e.g. [Elgato Stream Deck], [Jabra
headsets], [X-keys]) and exotic gamepad support. Gamepads designed for desktop
often use HID for gamepad inputs (buttons, joysticks, triggers) and outputs
(LEDs, rumble). Unfortunately, gamepad inputs and outputs are not well
standardized and web browsers often require custom logic for specific devices.
This is unsustainable and results in poor support for the long tail of older and
uncommon devices. It also causes the browser to depend on quirks in the behavior
of specific devices.

## Terminology {: #terminology }

HID consists of two fundamental concepts: reports and report descriptors.
Reports are the data that is exchanged between a device and a software client.
The report descriptor describes the format and meaning of data that the device
supports.

A HID (Human Interface Device) is a type of device that takes input from or
provides output to humans. It also refers to the HID protocol, a standard for
bi-directional communication between a host and a device that is designed to
simplify the installation procedure. The HID protocol was originally developed
for USB devices, but has since been implemented over many other protocols,
including Bluetooth.

Applications and HID devices exchange binary data through three report types:

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Report type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Input&nbsp;report</td>
        <td>Data that is sent from the device to the application (e.g. a button is pressed.)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Output&nbsp;report</td>
        <td>Data that is sent from the application to the device (e.g. a request to turn on the keyboard backlight.)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Feature&nbsp;report</td>
        <td>Data that may be sent in either direction. The format is device-specific.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

A report descriptor describes the binary format of reports supported by the
device. Its structure is hierarchical and can group reports together as distinct
collections within the top-level collection. The [format] of the descriptor is
defined by the HID specification.

A HID usage is a numeric value referring to a standardized input or output.
Usage values allow a device to describe the intended use of the device and the
purpose of each field in its reports. For example, one is defined for the left
button of a mouse. Usages are also organized into usage pages, which provide an
indication of the high-level category of the device or report.

## Using the WebHID API {: #use }

### Enabling via chrome://flags

To experiment with the WebHID API locally on all desktop platforms, without an
origin trial token, enable the `#experimental-web-platform-features` flag in
`chrome://flags`.

### Enabling support during the origin trial phase

The WebHID API is available on all desktop platforms (Chrome OS, Linux, macOS,
and Windows) as an origin trial in Chrome&nbsp;86. The origin trial is expected
to end just before Chrome&nbsp;89 moves to stable in February 2021. The API can
also be enabled using a flag.

{% include 'content/origin-trials.njk' %}

### Register for the origin trial {: #ot }

{% include 'content/origin-trial-register.njk' %}

### Feature detection {: #feature-detection }

To check if the WebHID API is supported, use:

```js
if ("hid" in navigator) {
  // The WebHID API is supported.
}
```

### Open a HID connection {: #open }

The WebHID API is asynchronous by design to prevent the website UI from
blocking when awaiting input. This is important because HID data can be received
at any time, requiring a way to listen to it.

To open a HID connection, first access a `HIDDevice` object. For this, you can
either prompt the user to select a device by calling
`navigator.hid.requestDevice()`, or pick one from `navigator.hid.getDevices()`
which returns a list of devices the website has been granted access to
previously.

The `navigator.hid.requestDevice()` function takes a mandatory object that
defines filters. Those are used to match any device connected with a USB vendor
identifier (`vendorId`), a USB product identifier (`productId`), a usage page
value (`usagePage`), and a usage value (`usage`). You can get those from [the
USB ID Repository] and the [HID usage tables document].

The multiple `HIDDevice` objects returned by this function represent multiple
HID interfaces on the same physical device.

```js
// Filter on devices with the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con USB Vendor/Product IDs.
const filters = [
  {
    vendorId: 0x057e, // Nintendo Co., Ltd
    productId: 0x2006 // Joy-Con Left
  },
  {
    vendorId: 0x057e, // Nintendo Co., Ltd
    productId: 0x2007 // Joy-Con Right
  }
];

// Prompt user to select a Joy-Con device.
const [device] = await navigator.hid.requestDevice({ filters });
```

```js
// Get all devices the user has previously granted the website access to.
const devices = await navigator.hid.getDevices();
```

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./webhid-prompt.jpg" class="w-screenshot" alt="Screenshot of a HID device prompt on a website.">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">User prompt for selecting a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con.
</figcaption>
</figure>

A `HIDDevice` object contains USB vendor and product identifiers for device
identification. Its `collections` attribute is initialized with a hierarchical
description of the device's report formats.

```js
for (let collection of device.collections) {
  // A HID collection includes usage, usage page, reports, and subcollections.
  console.log(`Usage: ${collection.usage}`);
  console.log(`Usage page: ${collection.usagePage}`);

  for (let inputReport of collection.inputReports) {
    console.log(`Input report: ${inputReport.reportId}`);
    // Loop through inputReport.items
  }

  for (let outputReport of collection.outputReports) {
    console.log(`Output report: ${outputReport.reportId}`);
    // Loop through outputReport.items
  }

  for (let featureReport of collection.featureReports) {
    console.log(`Feature report: ${featureReport.reportId}`);
    // Loop through featureReport.items
  }

  // Loop through subcollections with collection.children
}
```

The `HIDDevice` devices are by default returned in a "closed" state and must be
opened by calling `open()` before data can be sent or received.

```js
// Wait for the HID connection to open before sending/receiving data.
await device.open();
```

### Receive input reports {: #receive-input-reports }

Once the HID connection has been established, you can handle incoming input
reports by listening to the `"inputreport"` events from the device. Those events
contains the HID data as a [`DataView`] object (`data`), the HID device it belongs
to (`device`), and the 8-bit report ID associated with the input report
(`reportId`).

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./joycon-switch-photo.jpg" class="w-screenshot" alt="Red and blue nintendo switch photo.">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Nintendo Switch Joy-Con devices.</figcaption>
</figure>

Continuing with the previous example, the code below shows you how to detect
which button the user has pressed on a Joy-Con Right device so that you can
hopefully try it at home.

```js
device.addEventListener("inputreport", event => {
  const { data, device, reportId } = event;

  // Handle only the Joy-Con Right device and a specific report ID.
  if (device.productId !== 0x2007 && reportId !== 0x3f) return;

  const value = data.getUint8(0);
  if (value === 0) return;

  const someButtons = { 1: "A", 2: "X", 4: "B", 8: "Y" };
  console.log(`User pressed button ${someButtons[value]}.`);
});
```

### Send output reports {: #send-output-reports }

To send an output report to a HID device, pass the 8-bit report ID associated
with the output report (`reportId`) and bytes as a [`BufferSource`] (`data`) to
`device.sendReport()`. The returned promise resolves once the report has been
sent. If the HID device does not use report IDs, set `reportId` to 0.

The example below applies to a Joy-Con device and shows you how to make it
rumble with output reports.

```js
// First, send a command to enable vibration.
// Magical bytes come from https://github.com/mzyy94/joycon-toolweb
const enableVibrationData = [1, 0, 1, 64, 64, 0, 1, 64, 64, 0x48, 0x01];
await device.sendReport(0x01, new Uint8Array(enableVibrationData));

// Then, send a command to make the Joy-Con device rumble.
// Actual bytes are available in the sample below.
const rumbleData = [ /* ... */ ];
await device.sendReport(0x10, new Uint8Array(rumbleData));
```

{% Glitch { id: 'webhid-joycon-rumble', path: 'script.js', height: 480, allow: 'hid' } %}

### Send and receive feature reports {: #feature-reports }

Feature reports are the only type of HID data reports that can travel in both
directions. They allow HID devices and applications to exchange non standardized
HID data. Unlike input and output reports, feature reports are not received or
sent by the application on a regular basis.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./laptop-keyboard-photo.jpg" class="w-screenshot" alt="Black and silver laptop computer photo.">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Laptop keyboard</figcaption>
</figure>

To send a feature report to a HID device, pass the 8-bit report ID associated
with the feature report (`reportId`) and bytes as a [`BufferSource`] (`data`) to
`device.sendFeatureReport()`. The returned promise resolves once the report has
been sent. If the HID device does not use report IDs, set `reportId` to 0.

The example below illustrates the use of feature reports by showing you how to
request an Apple keyboard backlight device, open it, and make it blink.

```js
const waitFor = duration => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, duration));

// Prompt user to select an Apple Keyboard Backlight device.
const [device] = await navigator.hid.requestDevice({
  filters: [{ vendorId: 0x05ac, usage: 0x0f, usagePage: 0xff00 }]
});

// Wait for the HID connection to open.
await device.open();

// Blink!
const reportId = 1;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // Turn off
  await device.sendFeatureReport(reportId, Uint32Array.from([0, 0]));
  await waitFor(100);
  // Turn on
  await device.sendFeatureReport(reportId, Uint32Array.from([512, 0]));
  await waitFor(100);
}
```

{% Glitch { id: 'webhid-apple-keyboard-backlight', path: 'script.js', height: 480, allow: 'hid' } %}

To receive a feature report from a HID device, pass the 8-bit report ID
associated with the feature report (`reportId`)  to
`device.receiveFeatureReport()`. The returned promise resolves with a
[`DataView`] object that contains the contents of the feature report. If the HID
device does not use report IDs, set `reportId` to 0.

```js
// Request feature report.
const dataView = await device.receiveFeatureReport(/* reportId= */ 1);

// Read feature report contents with dataView.getInt8(), getUint8(), etc...
```

### Listen to connection and disconnection {: #connection-disconnection }

When the website has been granted permission to access a HID device, it can
actively receive connection and disconnection events by listening to `"connect"`
and `"disconnect"` events.

```js
navigator.hid.addEventListener("connect", event => {
  // Automatically open event.device or warn user a device is available.
});

navigator.hid.addEventListener("disconnect", event => {
  // Remove |event.device| from the UI.
});
```

## Dev Tips {: #dev-tips }

Debugging HID in Chrome is easy with the internal page, `chrome://device-log`
where you can see all HID and USB device related events in one single place.

## Demos {: #demos }

Some WebHID demos are listed at [web.dev/hid-examples]. Go have a look!

## Security and privacy {: #security-privacy }

The spec authors have designed and implemented the WebHID API using the core
principles defined in [Controlling Access to Powerful Web Platform Features],
including user control, transparency, and ergonomics. The ability to use this
API is primarily gated by a permission model that grants access to only a single
HID device at a time. In response to a user prompt, the user must take active
steps to select a particular HID device.

To understand the security tradeoffs, check out the [Security and Privacy
Considerations] section of the WebHID spec.

On top of this, Chrome inspects the usage of each top-level collection and if a
top-level collection has a protected usage (.e.g. generic keyboard, mouse), then
a website won't be able to send and receive any reports defined in that
collection. The full list of protected usages is [publicly available].

Note that security-sensitive HID devices (such as FIDO HID devices used for
stronger authentication) are also blocked in Chrome. See the [blocklist] file.
