## Introduction

If you're a web developer targeting the multi-device web, you likely have to 
test your sites and web apps across a number of different devices and 
configurations. Synchronized testing can help here and is an effective way to 
automatically perform the same interaction across a number of devices and 
browsers at the same time.

Synchronized testing can help solve two particularly time-consuming problems:

- **Keeping all your devices in sync with the URL you want to test.** Manually 
  loading them on each device is so yesterday, takes longer and makes it easier 
  to miss out on regressions.
- **Synchronizing interactions.** Being able to load up a page is great for 
  visual testing, but for interaction testing you ideally also want to be able 
  to synchronize scrolls, clicks and other behaviours. 

Thankfully if you have access to some of your target devices, there are a number 
of tools aimed at improving the flow from your desktop to your mobile devices. 
In this article, we will look at Ghostlab, Remote Preview, Adobe Edge Inspect 
and Grunt.

## Tools

### GhostLab (Mac)

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/tykqmqiVwnOsRrmQektw.png", alt="GhostLab for Mac by Vanamco", width="800", height="517" %}

</figure>

[Ghostlab](http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/) is a commercial Mac application ($49) 
designed to synchronise testing for sites and web apps across multiple devices. 
With minimum setup it allows you to simultaneously sync:

- Clicks
- Navigation
- Scrolls
- Form input (e.g login forms, sign-up)

This makes testing your site's end-to-end user experience on multiple devices 
very straightforward. Once you've opened your page in a browser on your devices, 
any changes to navigation (including refreshes) cause any other connected 
devices to refresh instantly. Ghostlab supports watching local directories, so 
this refresh also happens when you save edits to local files, keeping everything 
in sync always!

I found setting up Ghostlab a painless process. To get started, download, 
install and run the 
[trial](http://awesome.vanamco.com/downloads/ghostlab/latest/Ghostlab.dmg) (or 
full version if you're in the buying mood). You will then want to connect your 
Mac and the devices you wish to test to the same Wifi network so that they're 
discoverable.

Once Ghostlab is running, you can either click "+" to add a URL for testing or 
simply drag it from your browser's address bar. Alternatively, drag the local 
folder you wish to test over into the main window and a new site entry will be 
created. For this article, I'm testing a live version of 
[http://html5rocks.com](http://html5rocks.com). Cheeky, eh? ; )

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/OU4JcU5JRVLazL3tUgdf.png", alt="Choose a URL or local directory on your machine", width="800", height="410" %}
  <figcaption>Choose a URL or local directory on your machine</figcpation>
</figure>


You can then kick-start off a new Ghostlab server by clicking the ">" play 
button next to the name of your site. This starts a new server, available at an 
IP address specific to your network (e.g 
[http://192.168.21.43:8080](http://192.168.21.43:8080)).

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/hAHpmYqgtsXruQhdUsIO.jpg", alt="Ghostlab server locally proxying content from our URL", width="800", height="598" %}
  <figcaption>Ghostlab server locally proxying content from our URL</figcpation>
</figure>

Here, I've connected up a Nexus 4 and pointed Chrome for Android to the IP 
address Ghostlab gave me. That's all I have to do. Ghostlab doesn't require that 
you install a dedicated client per device like some other solutions and it means 
you can start testing even more quickly. 

Any device you connect to the Ghostlab URL will be added to the list of 
connected clients in the sidebar to the right of the main Ghostlab window. 
Double-clicking the device name displays additional details such as the screen 
size, OS and so on. You should now be able to test navigating and synchronizing 
clicks! Yay.

Ghostlab is also able to display some stats about connected devices like the UA 
string, viewport width and height, device pixel density, aspect ratio and more. 
At any time, you can manually change the base URL you are inspecting by clicking 
the settings cog next to an entry. This opens up a configuration window that 
looks like the below:

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/a9Zxmwcg1V108mX42H2e.png", alt="Configure files to watch, HTTP headers, character sets and more.", width="800", height="508" %}
  <figcaption>Configure files to watch, HTTP headers, character sets and more.</figcpation>
</figure>

I can now select one of my other connected devices, click on different links 
around HTML5Rocks and the navigation is synchronized both on my desktop Chrome 
(where I entered in the same Ghostlab URL) as well as across all of my devices. 

What's even better is that Ghostlab has an option allowing you to proxy all 
links going through the network so that instead of a click on 
[http://192.168.21.43:8080/www.html5rocks.com](http://192.168.21.43:8080/www.html5rocks.com) 
navigating to 
[www.html5rocks.com/en/performance](http://www.html5rocks.com/performance) 
(for example), which would break the automatic cross-device refresh suffered by 
other solutions, it can just translate this link into 
[http://192.168.21.43/www.htm5rocks.com/en/performance](http://192.168.21.43/www.htm5rocks.com/performance) 
so that navigating is completely seamless across all my devices.

To enable, check "Load all content through Ghostlab" under the "Content Loading" 
tab.

  <figcaption>Ghostlab can rewrite URLs so all resources are loaded through the Ghostlab proxy. Useful for synchronizing navigations to multiple pages</figcpation>

Seeing it in action:

  <figcaption>Synchronized testing of an Android, Windows 8 and Firefox OS phone with Ghostlab</figcpation>
</figure>

Ghostlab is capable of loading any number of sites or windows across any 
supported browser. This doesn't just let you test your site at different 
resolutions, but how your code behaves on different browsers and platforms. Yay!

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/EkUMeViMnNTjdRLrVKQG.gif", alt="Synchronizing scroll, clicks and navigation across all of the test devices", width="623", height="351" %}
  <figcaption>Synchronizing scroll, clicks and navigation across all of the test devices</figcpation>
</figure>

Ghostlab allows you to configure the setup for the project workspace you're 
previewing and you can specify whether you would like changes to the directory 
to be watched and refreshed when detected. This means changes cause all 
connected clients to be refreshed. No more manual refreshes!

You may be wondering what else Ghostlab can help with. Whilst it's certainly not 
a swiss-army knife, it also supports remote code inspection on connected 
devices. Through the main interface, double-clicking on any device name should 
bring up a "debug" option which will launch a version of the [Chrome DevTools](http://devtools.chrome.com) for 
you to play around with. 

Ghostlab makes this possible via the bundled [Weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/) remote web inspector, which 
lets you debug scripts and tweak styles on connected devices. Similar to the [remote debugging](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging) experience available for Chrome for Android, you can select elements, run some 
performance profiling and debug scripts. 

All in all, I was impressed with how quickly I was able to use Ghostlab for 
everyday testing across devices. If you're a freelancer, you might find the cost 
of the commerical license a little high (see below for more options).  However, 
I'm happy to recommend Ghostlab otherwise.

### Adobe Edge Inspect CC (Mac, Windows)

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/8U2DXCGXtItfi82pNOv1.png", alt="Adobe's Creative Cloud subscription includes Edge Inspect", width="800", height="512" %}
  <figcaption>Adobe's Creative Cloud subscription includes Edge Inspect</figcpation>
</figure>

Adobe Edge Inspect is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud subscription package, but 
also comes available as a free trial. It allows you to drive multiple iOS and 
Android devices with Chrome (via the Edge Inspector Chrome extension), so that 
if you browse to a particular URL all of your connected devices stay in sync. 

To get set up, first sign up for an [Adobe Creative 
Cloud](http://creative.adobe.com/) account or login to an existing account if 
you already have one.  Next, download and install [Edge 
Inspect](https://creative.adobe.com/inspect) from Adobe.com (available for Mac 
and Windows at present, but not Linux - sorry!).  Note the 
[docs](http://forums.adobe.com/docs/DOC-2535) for Edge Inspect are useful to 
keep at hand.

Once installed, you'll want to get the [Edge inspect 
extension](http://www.adobe.com/go/edgeinspect_chrome) for Chrome so that you 
can synchronize browsing between connected devices. 

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/cae6RFljZG7BS6zuNMrK.png", alt="The Edge Inspect CC Chrome Extension", width="325", height="214" %}
  <figcaption>The Edge Inspect CC Chrome Extension</figcpation>
</figure>

You will also need to install an Edge Inspect client on each device you wish to 
sync actions with. Thankfully clients are available for 
[iOS](http://www.adobe.com/go/edgeinspect_ios), 
[Android](http://www.adobe.com/go/edgeinspect_android) and 
[Kindle](http://www.adobe.com/go/edgeinspect_amazon).

With the installation process behind us, we can now start inspecting our pages. 
You'll need to make sure all your devices are connected to the same network for 
this to work. 

Start up Edge Inspect on your desktop, the Edge Inspect extension in Chrome and 
then the app on your devices (see below):

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/RrPK7JYnuiGoC77xcj1Q.png", alt="Connecting a device up to the Edge Inspect extension", width="605", height="451" %}
  <figcaption>Connecting a device up to the Edge Inspect extension</figcpation>
</figure>

We can now navigate to a site like HTML5Rocks.com on desktop and our mobile 
device will automatically navigate to the same page.

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/XAvQlt7WHiuPELPsHJKv.jpg", alt="Driving navigation of a URL across multiple connected devices", width="800", height="598" %}
  <figcaption>Driving navigation of a URL across multiple connected devices</figcpation>
</figure>

In the extension, you'll also now see your device listed with a <> symbol next 
to it as in the screenshot below. Clicking this will launch an instance of Weinre allowing you to inspect and debug your page. 

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/rWsxtUuWj17uJA92rrzG.png", alt="Connected devices appear with a <> symbol next to them, which can be used to launch the Weinre debugger", width="800", height="549" %}
  <figcaption>Connected devices appear with a <> symbol next to them, which can be used to launch the Weinre debugger</figcpation>
</figure>

Weinre is a DOM viewer and console, and lacks features from the Chrome DevTools like JavaScript debugging, profiling, and network waterfall. While it is the bare minimum of developer tooling, it's useful for sanity-checking DOM and JavaScript state.

  <figcaption>Debugging with Weinre</figcpation>
</figure>

The Edge Inspect extension also supports generating screenshots from connected devices with ease. Useful for layout testing or just getting captures of your page to share with others.

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/Nc1Lf9Fv72IDRWD8o2v1.png", alt="Screenshot generation with Edge Inspect", width="547", height="296" %}
  <figcaption>Screenshot generation with Edge Inspect</figcpation>
</figure>

For developers already paying for CC, Edge Inspect is a great solution. It does 
however come with a few caveats such as each device requiring a dedicated client 
to be installed and a little extra setup work that you may not find with an 
alternative like Ghostlab. 

### Remote Preview (Mac, Windows, Linux)

[Remote Preview](http://viljamis.com/blog/2012/remote-preview/) is an open 
source tool where you host HTML pages and content that you can display on 
multiple devices.

Remote preview executes an XHR call at an interval of every 1100ms to check if a 
URL in a configuration file has changed. If it finds that it has, the script 
updates the src attribute of an iframe loaded into the page for each device, 
loading the page into it. If there are no changes detected, the script will 
continue polling until a change is made.

<figure>
  {% Img src="image/T4FyVKpzu4WKF1kBNvXepbi08t52/ekGQXOwVV8IPlwEkwVDm.gif", alt="Synchronized URL testing across 27+ devices", width="800", height="450" %}
  <figcaption>Synchronized URL testing across 27+ devices</figcpation>
</figure>

This is great for chaining devices together and easily changing a URL across all 
of them. To get started:

1. [Download](https://github.com/viljamis/Remote-Preview) Remote Preview and move all of the files for it into a locally accessible server. This can be Dropbox, 
a development server or something else. 
1. Load up "index.html" from this download on all of your target devices. This 
page will be used as a driver and will load up the page you want to test using 
an iframe.
1. Edit "url.txt" (included in the download and now served on your server) with 
the URL you wish to preview. Save this file.
1. Remote Preview will notice that the url.txt file has changed and will refresh 
all connected devices to load up your URL.

Whilst a lo-fi solution, Remote Preview is free and works.

### Grunt + Live-Reload (Mac, Windows, Linux)

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) (and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)) are command-line 
tools used for scaffolding and building projects on the front-end. If you're 
already using these tools and have live-reload setup, it's easy to update your 
workflow to enable cross-device testing where each change you make in your 
editor causes a reload in any of the devices you've opened up your local app on.

You're probably used to using `grunt server`. When run from the root directory 
of your project, it watches for any changes to your source files and 
automatically refreshes the browser window. This is thanks to the 
grunt-contrib-watch task which we run as part of the server.

If you happen to have used Yeoman to scaffold out your project, it will have 
created a Gruntfile with everything you need to get live-reload working on your 
desktop. To get it functioning cross-device, you just need to change one 
property, which is the `hostname` (on your desktop). It should be listed under 
`connect`. If you notice `hostname` is set to `localhost` just change it to 
0.0.0.0. Next run `grunt server` and as usual, a new window should open 
displaying a preview of your page. The URL will probably look like 
[http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) (9000 is the port). 

Fire up a new tab or terminal and use `ipconfig | grep inet` to discover your 
system's internal IP. It may look like `192.168.32.20`. The last step is to open 
up a browser like Chrome on the device you would like to synchronize livereloads 
to and type in this IP address followed by the port number from earlier. i.e 
`192.169.32.20:9000`.

That's it! Live-reload should now cause any edits you make to source files on 
your desktop to trigger reloads in both your desktop browser *and* the browser 
on your mobile device. Awesome!

<figure>

  <figcaption>Cross-device live-reload in action. Each edit/save gives you a real-time for of your current page, great for responsive design testing.</figcpation>
</figure>

Yeoman also has a [Mobile generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-mobile) 
available which makes setting this workflow up a breeze.

### Emmet LiveStyle

Emmet LiveStyle is a browser and editor plugin that brings live CSS editing to 
your development workflow. It is currently available for Chrome, Safari and 
Sublime Text and supports bi-directional (editor to browser and vice-versa) 
editing. 

Emmet LiveStyle doesn't force a complete browser refresh when you make changes, 
but instead pushes CSS edits across the DevTools remote debugging protocol. What 
this means is that you can see changes made in your desktop editor in any 
connected version of Chrome, whether it be on desktop Chrome or Chrome for 
Android.

LiveStyle has what it calls "multi-view mode", which is ideal for testing and 
tweaking responsive designs across windows and devices. In multi-view mode, all 
editor updates are applied to all windows as are DevTools updates for the same 
page.

**With the LiveStyle package installed, to get started with live CSS editing:**

1. Start up Sublime Text and open up a CSS file in a project
1. Start Chrome and go to the page with the CSS you would like to edit
1. Open DevTools and go to the LiveStyle panel. Check the "Enable LiveStyle" 
option. Note: DevTools will need to be kept open during your live editing 
session for each window in order for style updates to be applied.
1. When this has been enabled, a list of stylesheets will be displayed on the 
left and a list of your editor files on the right. Select the editor file to be 
associated with the browser. That's it! Boom.

Now the list of editor files will be automatically updated when you edit, 
create, open or close files.

## Conclusions

Cross-device testing is still a new and fast moving space with many new 
contenders in development. Thankfully there exist a number of free and 
commercial tools for assuring your compatibility and testing across a wide 
number of device sets. 

That said, there's still a lot of potential for improvement in this area and we 
would encourage you to think about how the tooling for testing across devices 
can be further improved. Anything that reduces setup time and improves your 
cross-device workflow is a win.

### Issues

Perhaps the largest issues I ran into during testing with these tools was 
devices regularly going to sleep. This isn't a deal-breaker, but does get 
annoying after a while. Where possible it's a good idea to set your devices to 
not sleep as a workaround, however, keep in mind that this can drain your 
battery unless you're always plugged in.

I didn't personally run into any major issues with GhostLab. At $49 some may 
find the price a little steep; however, keep in mind if you're using it 
regularly it more or less pays for itself. One of the nicest things about the 
setup was not having to worry about installing and managing a client per target 
device. The same URL worked everywhere.

With Adobe Edge Inspect, I found having to install and use specific clients on 
each device a little bit tedious. I also found it didn't consistently refresh 
all of the clients connected up, meaning I had to do this myself from the Chrome 
extension. It also requires a subscription to Creative Cloud and is limited to 
loading up sites in the client rather than in a selected browser on your 
devices. This may limit your ability to accurately test.

Remote Preview functioned as advertised, but is extremely lightweight. This 
means for anything more than refreshing your site across devices, you'll need a 
more advanced tooling option. It won't for example, synchronize clicks or 
scrolls.

## Recommendations

If you're looking for a free cross-platform solution to get you started, I 
recommend using Remote Preview. For those working in a company looking for a 
paid-for solution, GhostLab has been consistently excellent in my experience but 
is only available for the Mac. For Windows users, Adobe Edge Inspect is your 
best call and minus some quirks, does generally get the job done. 

Grunt and LiveStyle are also excellent for augmenting your live iteration during 
development.
