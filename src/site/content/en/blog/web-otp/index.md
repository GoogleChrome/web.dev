## What is the Web OTP API?

These days, most people in the world own a mobile device and developers are
commonly using phone numbers as an identifier for users of their services.

There are a variety of ways to verify phone numbers, but a randomly generated
one-time password (OTP) sent by SMS to the number is one of the most common.
Sending this code back to the developer's server demonstrates control of the
phone number.

{% Aside %}
The Web OTP API was originally called the SMS Receiver API. You may still see
it named that way in some places.
{% endAside %}

This idea is already deployed in many scenarios to achieve:

* **Phone number as an identifier for the user.** When signing up for a new
  service, some websites ask for a phone number instead of an email address and
  use it as an account identifier.
* **Two step verification.** When signing in, a website asks for a one-time code
  sent via SMS on top of a password or other knowledge factor for extra
  security.
* **Payment confirmation.** When a user is making a payment, asking for a
  one-time code sent via SMS can help verify the person's intent.

The current process creates friction for users. Finding an OTP within an SMS
message, then copying and pasting it to the form is cumbersome, lowering
conversion rates in critical user journeys. Easing this has been a long standing
request for the web from many of the largest global developers. Android has [an
API that does exactly
this](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/). So does
[iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/about_the_password_autofill_workflow)
and
[Safari](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/enabling_password_autofill_on_an_html_input_element).

The Web OTP API lets your app receive specially-formatted messages bound to
your app's origin. From this, you can programmatically obtain an OTP from an SMS
message and verify a phone number for the user more easily.

{% Aside 'warning' %}
Attackers can spoof SMS and hijack a person's phone number. Carriers can also
recycle phone numbers to new users after an account is closed. While SMS OTP is
useful to verify a phone number for the use cases above, we recommend using
additional and stronger forms of authentication (such as multiple factors and
the [Web Authentication
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) to
establish new sessions for these users.

## See it in action

Let's say a user wants to verify their phone number with a website. The website
sends a text message to the user over SMS and the user enters the OTP from the
message to verify the ownership of the phone number.

With the Web OTP API, these steps are as easy as one tap for the
user, as demonstrated in the video. As the text message arrives, a bottom
sheet pops up and prompts the user to verify their
phone number. After clicking the **Verify** button within the bottom sheet,
the browser pastes the OTP into the form and the form is submitted without
the user needing to press **Continue**.

Try [the demo](https://sms-receiver-demo.glitch.me) yourself. It doesn't ask for
your phone number or send an SMS to your device, but you can send one from
another device by copying the text displayed in the demo. This works because it
doesn't matter who the sender is when using the Web OTP API.

1. Go to
   [https://sms-receiver-demo.glitch.me](https://sms-receiver-demo.glitch.me) in Chrome 81 or later.
1. Select **Chrome Stable** from the provided list.
1. Press **Copy** to copy the text message.
1. Using your SMS app send it to another phone.
1. Press **Verify**.
1. From the other phone, send yourself the copied text message via SMS.

Did you receive the SMS and see the prompt to enter the code to the input area?
That is how the Web OTP API works for users.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
If you are using a work profile on your Android device and the SMS Receiver does
not seem to be working, try installing and using Chrome on your personal profile
instead (i.e. the same profile in which you receive SMS messages).
{% endAside %}

## Using the Web OTP API

Using the Web OTP API consists of two parts: JavaScript in your web
app and formatted message text sent via SMS.

{% Aside %}
The Web OTP API requires a secure origin (HTTPS).
{% endAside %}

### Feature detection

Feature detection is the same as for many other APIs:

```js
if ('sms' in navigator) {
  ...
}
```

### Process the OTP

The Web OTP API itself is simple enough:

```js
const sms = await navigator.sms.receive();
```

Once a user taps **Verify**, displayed in the bottom sheet, the promise
containing the entire text message will resolve. You can use a regular
expression to extract the OTP and verify the user. Notably, you should parse and
use the SMS message assuming it could have been altered by an attacker inserting
their own SMSes into your app (e.g. following the formatting convention and
sending it right after you called `navigator.sms.receive()`). For example, if a
text message contains a six digit verification code following `otp=`, the code
would look like this:

```js
const code = sms.content.match(/^[\s\S]*otp=([0-9]{6})[\s\S]*$/m)[1];
```

You can now submit the code to the server to verify it.

### Formatting the SMS message

The API itself should look simple enough, but a critical part is to
format your SMS text message according to a specific convention. The message has
to be sent after `navigator.sms.receive()` is called and must comply with a
formatting convention.

The SMS message must be received on the device where `navigator.sms.receive()`
was called.

The message must adhere to the following formatting:

* The origin part of the URL of the website that invoked the API must be
  preceded by `For: `.
* The URL must contain (for [the time
  being](https://github.com/samuelgoto/sms-receiver/issues/4#issuecomment-528991114))
  a query parameter whose value is the application hash of the user's Chrome
  instance. (These are static strings. See the table below.)
* The URL must contain a query parameter `otp` whose value is the OTP.

An example message that can be retrieved by the browser would look like this:

```text
Your OTP is: 123456.

For: https://sms-receiver-demo.glitch.me/?otp=123456&xFJnfg75+8v
```

The application hash of Chrome instances are static. Use one of these strings
for development depending on which Chrome build you will be working with.

### Demos

Try various messages with the demo:
[https://sms-receiver-demo.glitch.me](https://sms-receiver-demo.glitch.me)

You may also fork it and create your version:
[https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sms-receiver-demo](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sms-receiver-demo).

### Problem with the implementation?

Did you find a bug with Chrome's implementation?

* File a bug at
  [https://new.crbug.com](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?components=Blink%3EContacts).
  Include as much detail as you can, simple instructions for reproducing, and
  set **Components** to `Blink>SMS`.

### Planning to use the API?

Are you planning to use the Web OTP API? Your public support helps us prioritize
features, and shows other browser vendors how critical it is to support them.
Send a Tweet to [@ChromiumDev](https://twitter.com/chromiumdev) with
`#smsreceiver` and let us know where and how you're using it.

## FAQ
### Why did you not align with Safari's one-time-code?

We [explored
options](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1639728)
similar to Safari's declarative
[`autocomplete="one-time-code"`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/enabling_password_autofill_on_an_html_input_element).
We believe our imperative approach provides a more flexible user experience and
reduces friction when verifying a phone number under certain circumstances. The
declarative approach is easier to implement for developers, but requires a form
field and at least several taps: focus on the input field, select the
one-time-code, then submit the form. Our approach (inspired by what native
[Android apps](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview)
do) means that people make only a single tap in the browser, inline with the
page content.

### Is it safe to use SMS as a way to authenticate?

While SMS OTP is useful to verify a phone number when the number is first
provided, phone number verification via SMS must be used carefully for
re-authentication since phone numbers can be hijacked and recycled by carriers.
Web OTP is a convenient re-auth and recovery mechanism, but services should
combine it with additional factors, such as a knowledge challenge, or use the
[Web Authentication
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API)
for strong authentication.

### Can't we omit the browser's app hash?

We would [like to remove
it](https://github.com/samuelgoto/sms-receiver/issues/4#issuecomment-528991114),
but it's currently a platform restriction. We are working with the Android
team to understand what's the best way to approach it.

### Will an SMS message timeout?

Yes. You can use [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) to abort the request before the timeout expires.

### Will the apk hash change for an installed PWA?

No. A PWA's app hash is the same as the browser it runs in.

### Can we localize the "For:" string required in the SMS?

Not yet. Ultimately, we are planning to remove it or otherwise allow for
localization.
