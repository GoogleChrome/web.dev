  Using the Media Capabilities API lets you better target video codecs, frame
  rates, and resolutions based on the capabilities of your users' devices.

In an experiment with the Media Capabilities API, YouTube saw a 7.1% increase in
MTBR with only a 0.4% decrease in average resolution of videos served.

MTBR (Mean Time Between Rebuffers) is total play time divided by the number of
rebuffering events.

## The Problem

Typically, media sites have several variants of each video that they can present
to users, encoded in different frame rates, resolutions, and codecs. Until
recently, web developers had to rely solely on `isTypeSupported()` or
`canPlayType()` to determine whether each variant could be played in an
individual user's browser.
While this told the developer whether media could be played at all, it didn't
provide an indication of playback quality, such as whether there would be frame
drops or device battery drain. Without this information, developers either had
to create their own heuristics or just assume that if a device could play a
codec/resolution combination, it could do so smoothly and with power efficiency.
For users with less capable devices, this often led to a poor experience.

## The Solution

The [Media Capabilities](https://wicg.github.io/media-capabilities/) API allows
websites to get more information about the client's video decode performance and
make an informed decision about which codec and resolution to deliver to the
user. Specifically, the API provides the developer with an estimate of the
smoothness and power efficiency of a particular codec and resolution
combination. This allows the developer to avoid scenarios where the client is
likely to have a poor playback experience.

In Chrome, the Media Capabilities API uses metrics from previous playbacks to
predict whether future playbacks in the same codec and at the same resolution
will be smoothly decoded.

## YouTube Case Study

YouTube used the [Media
Capabilities](https://wicg.github.io/media-capabilities/) API to prevent their
adaptive bitrate algorithm from automatically selecting resolutions that a
device could not play smoothly.

Users who were part of the experimental group collectively saw less frequent
rebuffers (the mean time between rebuffers, or MTBR, increased by 7.1%) while
the average resolution, measured by video height, served to the aggregate group
only declined by 0.4%. The substantial increase in the MTBR with the small corresponding reduction in average resolution indicates that this change
significantly improved quality for a small subset of users who previously had a
poor experience.
