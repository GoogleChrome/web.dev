In this post I want to share thinking on ways to solve split text animations and
interactions for the web that are minimal, accessible, and work across browsers.
Try the [demo](https://gui-challenges.web.app/split-text/dist/).

## Overview

Split text animations can be amazing. We'll be barely scratching the surface of
animation potential in this post, but it does provide a foundation to build
upon. The goal is to animate progressively. The text should be readable by
default, with the animation built on top. Split text motion effects can
get extravagant and potentially disruptive, so we will only manipulate HTML, or
apply motion styles if the user is OK with motion.

Here's a general overview of the workflow and results:
1. [Prepare](#preparing-motion-conditionals) reduced motion conditional
   variables for CSS and JS.
1. [Prepare](#splitting-letters-utility-function) split text utilities in
   JavaScript.
1. [Orchestrate](#split-orchestration) the conditionals and utilities on page
   load.
1. [Write](#splitting-animations-and-transitions) CSS transitions and animations
   for letters and words (the rad part!).

Here's a preview of the conditional results we're going for:

    width="800", height="517"
  %}
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    User prefers reduced motion: text is legible / unsplit
  </figcaption>
</figure>

If a user prefers reduced motion, we leave the HTML document alone and do no
animation. If motion is OK, we go ahead and chop it up into pieces. Here's a
preview of the HTML after JavaScript has split the text by letter.

    width="800", height="517"
  %}

  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Preparing motion conditionals

The conveniently [available](https://caniuse.com/prefers-reduced-motion) `@media
(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` media query will be used from CSS and
JavaScript in this project. This media query is our primary conditional for
deciding to split text or not. The CSS media query will be used to withhold
transitions and animations, while the JavaScript media query will be used to
withhold the HTML manipulation.

{% Banner 'neutral' %} **Question:** What else should be used to withhold split
text animations?{% endBanner %}


#### Preparing the CSS conditional

I used PostCSS to enable the syntax of [Media Queries Level 5](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/), where I can store
a media query boolean into a variable:

```css
@custom-media --motionOK (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference);
```

#### Preparing the JS conditional

In JavaScript, the browser provides a way to check media queries, I used
[destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
to extract and rename the boolean result from the media query check:

```js
const {matches:motionOK} = window.matchMedia(
  '(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)'
)
```

I can then test for `motionOK`, and only change the document if the user has not
requested to reduce motion.

```js
if (motionOK) {
  // document split manipulations
}
```

I can check the same value by using PostCSS to enable the `@nest` syntax from
[Nesting Draft 1](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting-1/). This allows me to
store all the logic about the animation and it's style requirements for the
parent and children, in one place:

```css
letter-animation {
  @media (--motionOK) {
    /* animation styles */
  }
}
```

With the PostCSS custom property and a JavaScript boolean, we're ready to
conditionally upgrade the effect. That rolls us into the next section where I
break down the JavaScript for transforming strings into elements.

## Splitting Text

Text letters, words, lines, etc., cannot be individually animated with CSS or JS.
To achieve the effect, we need boxes. If we want to animate each letter, then
each letter needs to be an element. If we want to animate each word, then each
word needs to be an element.

1. Create JavaScript utility functions for splitting strings into elements
1. Orchestrate the usage of these utilities

{% Aside %} In this demo I'll be splitting the text from JavaScript on the DOM
of the page. If you're in a framework or on the server, you could split the text
into elements from there, but do so respectfully.{% endAside %}

### Splitting letters utility function

A fun place to start is with a function which takes a string and returns each
letter in an array.

```js
export const byLetter = text =>
  [...text].map(span)
```

The
[spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
syntax from ES6 really helped make that a swift task.

### Splitting words utility function

Similar to splitting letters, this function takes a string and returns each word
in an array.

```js
export const byWord = text =>
  text.split(' ').map(span)
```

The
[`split()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
method on JavaScript strings allows us to specify which characters to slice at.
I passed an empty space, indicating a split between words.

### Making boxes utility function

The effect requires boxes for each letter, and we see in those functions, that
[`map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
is being called with a `span()` function. Here is the `span()` function.

```js
const span = (text, index) => {
  const node = document.createElement('span')

  node.textContent = text
  node.style.setProperty('--index', index)

  return node
}
```

It's crucial to note that a custom property called `--index` is being set with
the array position. Having the boxes for the letter animations is great, but
having an index to use in CSS is a seemingly small addition with a large impact.
Most notable in this large impact is
[staggering](https://css-tricks.com/different-approaches-for-creating-a-staggered-animation/).
We'll be able to use `--index` as a way of offsetting animations for a staggered
look.

### Utilities conclusion

The `splitting.js` module in completion:

```js
const span = (text, index) => {
  const node = document.createElement('span')

  node.textContent = text
  node.style.setProperty('--index', index)

  return node
}

export const byLetter = text =>
  [...text].map(span)

export const byWord = text =>
  text.split(' ').map(span)
```

Next is importing and using these `byLetter()` and `byWord()` functions.

## Split orchestration

With the splitting utilities ready to use, putting it all together means:
1. **Finding** which elements to split
1. **Splitting** them and **replacing** text with HTML

After that, CSS takes over and will animate the elements / boxes.

### Finding Elements

I chose to use attributes and values to store information about the desired
animation and how to split the text. I liked putting these declarative options
into the HTML. The attribute `split-by` is used from JavaScript, to find
elements and create boxes for either letters or words. The attribute
`letter-animation` or `word-animation` is used from CSS, to target element
children and apply transforms and animations.

Here's a sample of HTML that demonstrates the two attributes:

```html
<h1 split-by="letter" letter-animation="breath">animated letters</h1>
<h1 split-by="word" word-animation="trampoline">hover the words</h1>
```

### Finding elements from JavaScript

I used the CSS selector syntax for attribute presence to gather the list of
elements which want their text split:

```js
const splitTargets = document.querySelectorAll('[split-by]')
```

### Finding elements from CSS

I also used the attribute presence selector in CSS to give all letter animations
the same base styles. Later, we'll use the attribute value to add more specific
styles to achieve an effect.

```css
letter-animation {
  @media (--motionOK) {
    /* animation styles */
  }
}
```

### Splitting text in place

For each of the split targets we find in JavaScript, we'll split their text
based on the value of the attribute and map each string to a `<span>`. We can
then replace the text of the element with the boxes we made:

```js
splitTargets.forEach(node => {
  const type = node.getAttribute('split-by')
  let nodes = null

  if (type === 'letter') {
    nodes = byLetter(node.innerText)
  }
  else if (type === 'word') {
    nodes = byWord(node.innerText)
  }

  if (nodes) {
    node.firstChild.replaceWith(...nodes)
  }
})
```

#### Orchestration conclusion

`index.js` in completion:

```js
import {byLetter, byWord} from './splitting.js'

const {matches:motionOK} = window.matchMedia(
  '(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)'
)

if (motionOK) {
  const splitTargets = document.querySelectorAll('[split-by]')

  splitTargets.forEach(node => {
    const type = node.getAttribute('split-by')
    let nodes = null

    if (type === 'letter')
      nodes = byLetter(node.innerText)
    else if (type === 'word')
      nodes = byWord(node.innerText)

    if (nodes)
      node.firstChild.replaceWith(...nodes)
  })
}
```

The JavaScript could be read in the following English:
1. Import some helper utility functions.
1. Check if motion is ok for this user, if not do nothing.
1. For each element that wants to be split.
    1. Split them based on how they want to be split.
    1. Replace text with elements.

## Splitting animations and transitions

The above splitting document manipulation has just unlocked a multitude of
potential animations and effects with CSS or JavaScript. There are a few links
at the bottom of this article to help inspire your splitting potential.

Time to show what you can do with this! I'll share 4 CSS driven animations and
transitions. 🤓

### Split letters

As a foundation for the split letter effects, I found the following CSS to be
helpful. I put all transitions and animations behind the motion media query and
then give each new child letter `span` a display property plus a style for what
to do with white spaces:

```css
[letter-animation] > span {
  display: inline-block;
  white-space: break-spaces;
}
```

The white spaces style is important so that the spans which are only a space,
aren't collapsed by the layout engine. Now onto the stateful fun stuff.

#### Transition split letters example

This example uses CSS transitions to the split text effect. With transitions we
need states for the engine to animate between, and I chose three states: no
hover, hover in sentence, hover on a letter.

When the user hovers the sentence, aka the container, I scale back all the
children as if the user pushed them further away. Then, as the user hovers a
letter, I bring it forward.

{% Video
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/TTG7vmfEJRAlRISqqIIA.mp4",
  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true"
%}

```css
@media (--motionOK) {
  [letter-animation="hover"] {
    &:hover > span {
      transform: scale(.75);
    }

    & > span {
      transition: transform .3s ease;
      cursor: pointer;

      &:hover {
        transform: scale(1.25);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Animate split letters example

This example uses a predefined `@keyframe` animation to infinitely animated each
letter, and leverages the inline custom property index to create a stagger
effect.

{% Video
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/Y9wcyj9AMwjn2XDASL2u.mp4",
  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true"
%}

```css
@media (--motionOK) {
  [letter-animation="breath"] > span {
    animation:
      breath 1200ms ease
      calc(var(--index) * 100 * 1ms)
      infinite alternate;
  }
}

@keyframes breath {
  from {
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(-5px) scale(1.25);
    text-shadow: 0 0 25px var(--glow-color);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  }
}
```

{% Aside 'objective' %} CSS `calc()` will use the unit type from the last item
in the calculation. In the above case, that's 1ms. It's used strategically to
convert the otherwise unitless number, into a value of `<time>` for the
animation. {% endAside %}

### Split words

Flexbox worked as a container type for me here in these examples, nicely
leveraging the `ch` unit as a healthy gap length.

```css
word-animation {
  display: inline-flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1ch;
}
```

<figure class="w-figure">
  {% Video
    src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/qgTmqbho48bH9VE35HYj.mp4",
    class="w-screenshot",
    autoplay="true",
    loop="true",
    muted="true"
  %}
  <figcaption class="w-figure">
    Flexbox devtools showing the gap between words
  </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Transition split words example

In this transition example I use hover again. As the effect initially hides the
content until hover, I ensured that the interaction and styles were only applied
if the device had the capability to hover.

{% Video
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/2oIFqmTm8QIoNAhRiJQl.mp4",
  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true"
%}

```css
@media (hover) {
  [word-animation="hover"] {
    overflow: hidden;
    overflow: clip;

    & > span {
      transition: transform .3s ease;
      cursor: pointer;

      &:not(:hover) {
        transform: translateY(50%);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Animate split words example

In this animation example I use CSS `@keyframes` again to create a staggered
infinite animation on a regular paragraph of text.

{% Video
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/fXANvKVQB8wiIYfaSp56.mp4",
  class="w-screenshot",
  autoplay="true",
  loop="true",
  muted="true"
%}

```css
[word-animation="trampoline"] > span {
  display: inline-block;
  transform: translateY(100%);
  animation:
    trampoline 3s ease
    calc(var(--index) * 150 * 1ms)
    infinite alternate;
}

@keyframes trampoline {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(100%);
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  }
}
```
