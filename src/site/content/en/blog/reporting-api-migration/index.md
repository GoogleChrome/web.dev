{% Banner 'caution', 'body' %} This post covers how to migrate to the new version of the Reporting
API (v1). If you're new to the Reporting API or need detailed usage examples, head over to the [main
post on the Reporting API](/reporting-api) instead. {% endBanner %}

The [Reporting API](/reporting-api) informs you about errors that happen across your site as visitors use it. It gives
you visibility on browser interventions, browser crashes, Content-Security-Policy violations,
COOP/COEP violations, deprecation warnings and more.

**A new version of the Reporting API is available. The new API is leaner and more likely to be
supported across browsers.**

{% Aside %} The legacy Reporting API is named _Reporting API v0_. The new Reporting API is named
_Reporting API v1_. {% endAside %}

## Summary

### Site developers

**If you already have reporting functionality for your site**: migrate to v1 by using the new header
(`Reporting-Endpoints`), but keep the legacy header around for some time (`Report-To`).
See [Migration: example code](#migration:-example-code).

**If you're adding reporting functionality to your site just now**: use only the new header
(`Reporting-Endpoints`).

⚠️ In both cases, make sure to set the `Reporting-Endpoints` header on all responses that might
generate reports.

### Reporting service developers

If you're maintaining an endpoint service or are operating your own, expect **more traffic** as you
or external developers migrate to the Reporting API v1 (`Reporting-Endpoints` header).

Keep reading for details and example code!

## Network Error Logging

{% Banner 'caution', 'body' %}

If you use [Network Error Logging](https://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/), continue using
`Report-To` (v0) because Network Error Logging isn't supported in the Reporting API v1.
{% endBanner %}

A new mechanism for Network Error Logging will be developed. Once that becomes available, switch from Reporting API v0 to that new mechanism.

## Demo and code

- [Demo site: new reporting API (v1)](https://reporting-api-demo.glitch.me)
- [Code](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/reporting-api-demo) for the demo site

## Differences between v0 and v1

### What's changing

- The API surface is different.

  {% Compare 'worse', 'v0 (legacy)' %}

  ```http
  Report-To: { group: "main-endpoint", "max_age": 86400, "endpoints": [ { "url": ... }, { "url": ... }] }, { group: "default-endpoint", "max_age": 86400, "endpoints": [ { "url": ... }, { "url": ... }] }
  Document-Policy: ...; report-to main-endpoint
  ```

  {% CompareCaption %}
  v0 uses the `Report-To` header to configure **named endpoint groups**, and the `report-to` directive in other headers to reference these endpoint groups.
  {% endCompareCaption %}

  {% endCompare %}

  {% Compare 'better', 'v1 (new)' %}

  ```http
  Reporting-Endpoints: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main", default="https://reports.example/default"
  Document-Policy: ...; report-to main-endpoint
  ```

  {% CompareCaption %}
  v1 uses the `Reporting-Endpoints` header to configure **named
  endpoints**. Like v0, it uses the `report-to` directive in other headers to reference these endpoint groups.
  {% endCompareCaption %}
  {% endCompare %}

- The scope of the report is different.

  {% Compare 'worse', 'v0 (legacy)' %}

  With v0, you can set reporting endpoints on some responses only. Other documents (pages) on that
  origin would automatically use these ambient endpoints.

  {% endCompare %}

  {% Compare 'better', 'v1 (new)' %}

  With v1, you need to set the `Reporting-Endpoints` header on all responses that might generate
  reports. {% endCompare %}

- Both APIs support the same report types, with one exception: v1 does not support **Network Error reports**. Read more in the [migration steps](#migration-steps).
- v0 is not and will not be supported across browsers. v1 is more likely to be supported across
  multiple browsers in the future.

### What remains unchanged

- The format and structure of the reports is unchanged.
- The request sent by the browser to the endpoint remains a `POST` request of `Content-type`
  `application/reports+json`.
- Mapping certain endpoints to certain report types is supported in both v0 and v1.
- The role of the `default` endpoint is unchanged.
- The Reporting API v1 has no impact on the [`ReportingObserver`](/reporting-observer).
  `ReportingObserver` continues getting access to all observable reports, and their format is
  identical.

## Endpoint developers: Expect more traffic

If you've set up your own server as a reporting endpoint, or if you're developing or maintaining a
report collector as a service, expect more traffic to that endpoint.

This is because reports aren't batched with the Reporting API v1 as they are with the Reporting API v0. Therefore,
as application developers start migrating to the Reporting API v1, the **number of reports** will
remain similar, but the **volume of requests** to the endpoint server will increase.

## Application developers: Migrate to `Reporting-Endpoints` (v1)

### What should you do?

Using the new Reporting API (v1) has several benefits ✅:

- Browser signals are [positive](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5712172409683968), which means
  that cross-browser support can be expected for v1 (unlike v0 that is only supported in Chrome and
  Edge).
- The API is leaner.
- Tooling is being developed around the new Reporting API (v1).

With this in mind:

- If your site already uses the Reporting API v0 with the `Report-To` header, migrate to the
  Reporting API v1 (see the [migration steps](#migration-steps)). If your site already uses
  reporting functionality for Content-Security-Policy violations, check the specific [migration
  steps for CSP reporting](#migration-steps-for-csp-reporting).
- If your site doesn't already use the Reporting API and you're now adding reporting functionality:
  use the new Reporting API (v1) (the `Reporting-Endpoints` header). **There's one exception to
  this**: if you need to use Network Error Logging, use `Report-To` (v0). Network Error Logging
  currently isn't supported in the Reporting API v1. A new mechanism for Network Error Logging will
  be developed⏤until that's available, use the Reporting API v0. If you need Network Error Logging
  **alongside** other report types, use **both** `Report-To` (v0) and `Reporting-Endpoints` (v1). v0
  gives you Network Error Logging and v1 gives you reports of all other types.

### Migration steps

Your goal in this migration is to **not lose reports** you used to get with v0.

{% Aside %} Because only Chrome and Edge support the Reporting API v0, you don't need to focus on
other browsers during your migration to v1. However, keep in mind that broader browser support may
be coming. There are no tracking bugs for these browsers at the moment but this may change. {%
endAside
%}

1. **Step 1 (do now)**: Use both headers: `Report-To` (v0) and `Reporting-Endpoints` (v1).

   With this, you get:

   - Reports from newer Chrome and Edge clients thanks to `Reporting-Endpoints` (v1).
   - Reports from older Chrome and Edge clients thanks to `Report-To` (v0).

   Browser instances that support `Reporting-Endpoints` will use `Reporting-Endpoints`, and
   instances that don't will fallback to `Report-To`. The request and report format is the same for
   v0 and v1.

2. **Step 2 (do now):** Ensure that the `Reporting-Endpoints` header is set on all responses that
   might generate reports.

   With v0, you could choose to set reporting endpoints on some responses only, and other documents
   (pages) on that origin would use this "ambient" endpoint. With v1, because of the difference in
   scoping, you need to set the `Reporting-Endpoints` header on all responses that might generate
   reports.

3. **Step 3 (start later):** Once all or most of your users have updated to later Chrome or Edge
   installs (96 and later), remove `Report-To` (v0) and keep only `Reporting-Endpoints`.

   One exception: if you do need Network Error Logging reports, keep `Report-To` until a new
   mechanism is in place for Network Error Logging.

See code examples in the [migration cookbook](#basic-migration).

### Migration steps for CSP reporting

There are two ways [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
violation reports can be configured:

- With the CSP header alone via the `report-uri` directive. This has wide browser support, across
  Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. Reports are sent with the content-type `application/csp-report`
  and have a format that's specific to CSP. These reports are called "CSP Level 2 Reports" and do
  **not** rely on the Reporting API.
- With the Reporting API, that is via `Report-To` header (legacy) or the newer
  `Reporting-Endpoints` (v1). This is supported in Chrome and Edge only. Report requests have the
  same format as other Reporting API requests, and the same content-type `application/reports+json`.

Using the first approach (only `report-uri`) is [no longer
recommended](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri) and using the second approach has a few benefits. In particular, it enables you to using a single way to set up reporting for all report types as well as to set a generic endpoint (because all report requests generated via the Reporting API⏤CSP **and** others⏤have the same format `application/reports+json`.

However, [only a few browsers support
`report-to`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-to).
Thus it's recommended that you keep `report-uri` alongside the Reporting API approach (`Report-To`
or better, `Reporting-Endpoints`) in order to get CSP violation reports from multiple browsers. In a
browser which recognizes `report-uri` and `report-to`, `report-uri` will be ignored if `report-to`
is present. In a browser which recognizes only `report-uri`, only `report-uri` will be considered.

1. **Step 1 (do now)**: If you haven't added it yet, add `report-to` alongside `report-uri`.
   Browsers that support only `report-uri` (Firefox) will use `report-uri`, and browsers that also
   support `report-to`(Chrome, Edge) will use `report-to`. To specify the named endpoints you'll use
   in `report-to`, use both headers `Report-To` and `Reporting-Endpoints`. This ensures that you get
   reports from both older and newer Chrome and Edge clients.

2. **Step 3 (start later):** Once all or most of your users have updated to later Chrome or Edge
   installs (96 and later), remove `Report-To` (v0) and keep only `Reporting-Endpoints`. Keep
   `report-uri` so you still get reports for browsers that only support it.

See code examples for these steps in [CSP reporting migration](#csp-reporting-migration).

### Migration: example code

#### Overview

If you're using the legacy Reporting API (v0) to get violation reports for a a COOP
(`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header), a COEP (`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`) or a document policy
(`Document-Policy` header): you do not need to change these policy headers themselves as you migrate
to Reporting API v1. What you do need is to migrate from the legacy `Report-To` header to the new
`Reporting-Endpoints` header.

If you're using the legacy Reporting API (v0) to get violation reports for a CSP
(`Content-Security-Policy` header), you may need to tweak your `Content-Security-Policy` as part of
your migration to the new Reporting API (v1).

#### Basic migration

{% Compare 'worse', 'Legacy code (with v0)' %}

```http
Report-To: { group: "main-endpoint", "endpoints": [ { "url": "https://reports.example/main" }] }, { group: "default-endpoint", "endpoints": [ { "url": "https://reports.example/default" }] }
```

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New code (transition code with v0 alongside v1)' %}

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main", default="https://reports.example/default"
Report-To: { group: "main-endpoint", "max_age": 86400, "endpoints": [ { "url": "https://reports.example/main" }] }, { group: "default-endpoint", "max_age": 86400, "endpoints": [ { "url": "https://reports.example/default" }] }
```

{% CompareCaption %}

If you already have reporting functionality in your site, keep `Report-To` **only temporarily**
(until most Chrome and Edge clients have been updated) to avoid losing reports.

If you need Network Error Logging, keep `Report-To` **until Network Error Logging replacement
becomes available**.

{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New code (with v1 only)' %}

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main", default="https://reports.example/default"
```

{% CompareCaption %}

This is what your code can look like in the future, once most Chrome and Edge clients have been updated and support the API v1.

{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

Note that with v1, you can still send specific report **types** to specific **endpoints**. But you
can have only one URL per endpoint.

#### Observing all pages

{% Compare 'worse', 'Legacy code (with v0), for example with Express' %}

```javascript
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.set("Report-To", …)
  response.render(...)
});
app.get("/page1", (request, response) => {
  response.render(...)
});
```

{% CompareCaption %} With v0, you can set reporting endpoints on some responses only. Other
documents (pages) on that origin automatically use these ambient endpoints. Here, the endpoints set
for `"/"` are used for all responses, for example for `page1`. {% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New code (with v1), for example with Express' %}

```javascript
// Use a middleware to set the reporting endpoint(s) for *all* requests.
app.use(function(request, response, next) {
  response.set("Reporting-Endpoints", …);
  next();
});

app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.render(...)
});

app.get("/page1", (request, response) => {
  response.render(...)
});
```

{% CompareCaption %} With v1, you need to set the `Reporting-Endpoints` header on all
responses that might generate reports. {% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

#### CSP reporting migration

{% Compare 'worse', 'Legacy code, with report-uri only' %}

```http
Content-Security-Policy: ...; report-uri https://reports.example/main
```

{% CompareCaption %} Using only `report-uri` is [no longer
recommended](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri).
If your code looks like above, migrate. See the New code examples below (in green). {%
endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'worse', 'Better legacy code, with report-uri and the report-to directive with the
Report-To (v0) header' %}

```http
Content-Security-Policy: ...; report-uri https://reports.example/main; report-to main-endpoint
Report-To: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main"
```

{% CompareCaption %} This is better: this code uses report-to, the newer replacement to
report-uri. It still keeps report-uri around for backwards compatibility; several
browsers don't support
[`report-to`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-to)
but do support
[`report-uri`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri).

Still, this could be better: this codes uses the Reporting API v0 (`Report-To` header). Migrate to v1: see the
'New code' examples below (in green).

{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better', 'New code, with report-uri and the report-to directive with the Reporting-Endpoints (v1) header' %}

```http
Content-Security-Policy: ...; report-uri https://reports.example/main; report-to main-endpoint
Reporting-Endpoints: main-endpoint="https://reports.example/main"
Report-To: ...
```

{% CompareCaption %}

Keep the `report-uri` directive alongide the `report-to` directive until the `report-to` directive
is supported across browsers. See the [browser compatibility
table](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-to).

Keep `Report-To` alongside `Reporting-Endpoints` temporarily. Once most of your Chrome and Edge
visitors have upgraded to 96+ browser versions, remove `Report-To`.

{% endCompareCaption %}

{% endCompare %}
