No matter what you buildâ€”be it a next generation video editing app, an addictive word game, or a
future online social networking appâ€”you will always find yourself in need of a few basic building
blocks:

- The video editing app will probably allow the user to _save_ the edited video.
- Your game will maybe allow the user to _share_ game progress with friends.
- An online social networking app will highly likely allow the user to _paste_ images into a post.

## No universal way to realize these patterns

These were just a couple of examples of such patterns, and there are many more. But all of these
have one thing in common: there is no universal way to realize them.

### Sharing progress

For example, not all browsers implement the [Web Share API](/web-share/), so in some cases you will
have to fall back to a different approach, like
[Twitter's Web Intents](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/guides/web-intent),
or copying to the clipboard, which is the
[approach](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1471493886031773707) chosen in
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) when the Web Share API isn't implemented.
Phew, barely got this one:

```

### Saving files

When it comes to saving, the go-to approach is to use the
[File System Access API](/file-system-access/), so you end up with a `FileSystemFileHandle`, which
allows you to implement a true [save, edit, save flow](/excalidraw-and-fugu/#saving-files). The next
best thing is to fall back to a classic `<a download>`, which likewise lets the user save data, but
has the downside of creating new files on each download, so they end up with `my-video.mp4`,
`my-video (1).mp4`, `my-video (2).mp4`, etc.

### Pasting images

To conclude the introductory examples, not all browsers support pasting images into a web app, so
you can fall back to using the Drag and Drop API or showing a file picker, which is not as elegant as
the [Async Clipboard API](/async-clipboard), but at least it works.

## The new patterns

With this out of the way, the new pattern sections are:

### Clipboard patterns

[Clipboard patterns](/patterns/clipboard/) for everything concerned with the system clipboard like
copying and pasting of all sorts of things.

### Files patterns

[Files patterns](/patterns/files/) for everything concerned with files and directories; be it
saving, opening, dragging and dropping, receiving or sharing.

### Advanced apps patterns

[Advanced apps patterns](/patterns/advanced-apps/) for everything concerned with advanced app
features like providing app shortcuts, periodically syncing data in the background, showing app
badges, and many more.

## Feedback

I hope these patterns will help you build amazing apps, and I'm looking forward to your feedback!
