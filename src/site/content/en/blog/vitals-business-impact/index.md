## Why Core Web Vitals matter to your users and business

Different stakeholders in an organization can have different priorities.
Core Web Vitals can bring them all on the same page by focusing on
optimizing user-centric metrics and the resulting business growth.

The path to good Core Web Vitals can vary from site to site
depending on where they are in the performance journey and how complex the site design is.
It can range from grabbing the low-hanging fruit and getting meaningful results;
to implementing complex solutions that fix challenging issues.
Regardless of the amount of time spent,
decision makers should treat this as a long term investment into growth of their business.
Delivering a fast and seamless navigation experience delights users
and helps turn them into loyal and returning customers.
For product managers, performance should be an important criteria
that defines the quality and success of new product features.
And product excellence and working on interesting challenges improves developer satisfaction as well.

While [Core Web Vitals as a ranking signal](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/more-details-page-experience)
gives additional motivation to invest time in performance,
adopting Core Web Vitals has many other short- and long-term benefits beyond ranking.
Let's explore several case studies of global and local brands who adopted Core Web Vitals
(before it had impact on ranking) because of its focus on user experience.

## Case studies

### Vodafone

[Vodafone (Italy) improved LCP](/vodafone) by **31%** to achieve **8% more sales**.

alt="8% more sales",
width="800", height="368" %}

#### Techniques

- Server Side Render the critical HTML.
- Reduce render blocking Javascript.
- Image optimization techniques.
- Resize hero image; defer non critical resources.

#### Key learnings

- A/B testing is the best way to measure the meaningful impact.
- A/B should be a server side one.

### iCook

iCook improved CLS by 15% to achieve 10% more ad revenue.

alt="Chart showing ad revenue increasing.",
width="800", height="422" %}

#### Techniques

- Less variability in ad unit size and fixed size ad slots pre-allocated in UI.
- Optimized ad script loading logic to prioritize header bidding and defer non-critical JS.

#### Key learnings

Fill rate might get impacted but eventually revenue uplifts with ads viewability improvement.

### Tokopedia

Tokopedia improved LCP by 55% and saw 23% better average session duration.

alt="Before 3.78s, after 1.72s.",
width="800", height="722" %}

#### Techniques

- Server-side render (SSR) LCP element.
- Preload LCP Element.
- Image optimization (compression, WebP, lazy load non-critical images).

#### Key learnings

- Built a performance monitoring dashboard
to monitor progress and impact across teams.
- Experimented with different rendering techniques
(for example, SSR LCP element vs SSR above the fold content vs Full client-side rendering).

### Redbus

CWV fixes contributed to 80-100% mobile conversion rates(mCVR) and significant domain ranking uplift across Redbusâ€™s global market properties.

alt="192% domain ranking uplift in Columbia",
width="800", height="360" %}

#### Techniques

- Fixing slots for page components and removing unoptimized tag insertion scripts [improved CLS](/optimize-cls).
- [Optimizing third-party scripts](/controlling-third-party-scripts) and building microservices with single responsibility principle significantly reduced TTI and TBT.

#### Key learnings

- Reducing CLS from 1.65 to 0 significantly uplifted their domain rankings globally.
- Reducing TTI from around 8&nbsp;s to  around 4&nbsp;s and TBT from around 1200&nbsp;ms to around 700&nbsp;ms contributed to an 80-100% increase in mCVR across global properties.
- [Using RUM tools](/vitals-measurement-getting-started) helped capture the real world performance metrics in lower tier markets.
- Adopting a [performance culture](/performance-budgets-101) is very important to avoid regression. This also improves team productivity thanks to optimized code, faster releases, and fewer production issues.

The case studies above show that you can achieve a lot
by adopting best practices and implementing quick wins.
Here are a few more real-world examples of this point.

GYAO saw 3.1x LCP and 108 percent improvement in click-through rate",

The above results were achieved by grabbing low hanging fruit such as:
