In this post I want to share thinking on building a Settings component for the
web that is responsive, supports multiple device inputs, and works across
browsers. Try the [demo](https://gui-challenges.web.app/settings/dist/).

If you prefer video, or want a UI/UX preview of what we're building, here's a
shorter walkthrough on YouTube:

## Overview

I've broken out the aspects of this component into the following sections:

1. [Layouts](#layouts)
1. [Color](#color)
1. [Custom range input](#custom-range)
1. [Custom checkbox input](#custom-checkbox)
1. [Accessibility considerations](#accessibility)
1. [JavaScript](#javascript)

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} 
The CSS snippets below assume PostCSS with 
[PostCSS Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features). 
Intent is to practice early and often with syntax in early drafts or 
experimentally available in browsers. Or as the plugin likes to say, 
"Use tomorrow's CSS today".
{% endAside %}

## Layouts

This is the first GUI Challenge demo to be **all CSS Grid**! Here's each grid 
highlighted with the [Chrome DevTools for grid](https://goo.gle/devtools-grid):

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/h6LZhScslprBcFol4gGp.png",
  alt="Colorful outlines and gap spacing overlays that help show all the boxes that make up the settings layout",
  class="w-screenshot",
  width="800", height="563"
%}

{% Banner 'neutral' %}
To highlight your grid layouts:
1. Open Chrome DevTools with `cmd+opt+i` or `ctrl+alt+i`.
1. Select the Layout tab next to the Styles tab.
1. Under the Grid layouts section, check on all the layouts.
1. Change the colors of all layouts.
{% endBanner %}

### Just for gap

The most common layout:

```css
foo {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--something);
}
```

I call this layout "just for gap" because it only uses grid to add gaps between blocks. 

Five layouts use this strategy, here's all of them displayed:

{% Img 
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/zYWSVLzdtrh1K8p8yUuA.png", 
  alt="Vertical grid layouts highlighted with outlines and filled in gaps", 
  width="800", 
  height="568" 
%}

The `fieldset` element, which contains each input group (`.fieldset-item`), is using `gap: 1px` to
create the hairline borders between elements. No tricky border solution!

<div class="w-columns">
{% Compare 'better', 'Filled gap' %}

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1px;
  background: var(--bg-surface-1);

  & > .fieldset-item {
    background: var(--bg-surface-2);
  }
}
```

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'worse', 'Border trick' %}

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;

  & > .fieldset-item {
    background: var(--bg-surface-2);
    
    &:not(:last-child) {
      border-bottom: 1px solid var(--bg-surface-1);
    }
  }
}
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

### Natural grid wrapping

The most complex layout ended up being the macro layout, the logical layout
system between `<main>` and `<form>`. 

#### Centering wrapping content

Flexbox and grid both provide abilities to `align-items` or
`align-content`, and when dealing with wrapping elements, `content` layout
alignments will distribute space amongst the children as a group. 

```css
main {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-xl);
  place-content: center;
}
```

The main element is using `place-content: center` [alignment
shorthand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-content) so
that the children are centered vertically and horizontally in both one and two column layouts.

{% Video 
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/IQI2PofA6gpNFUkDrvKo.mp4",
  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true" 
%}

Watch in the above video how the "content" stays centered, even though wrapping
has occurred.

#### Repeat auto-fit minmax

The `<form>` uses an adaptive grid layout for each section. 
This layout switches from one to two columns based on available space.

```css
form {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-xl) var(--space-xxl);
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(10ch, 100%), 35ch));
  align-items: flex-start;
  max-width: 89vw;
}
```

This grid has a different value for `row-gap` (--space-xl) than `column-gap` (--space-xxl)
to put that custom touch on the responsive layout. When the columns stack, we
want a large gap, but not as large as if we're on a wide screen.

The `grid-template-columns` property uses 3 CSS functions: `repeat()`, `minmax()` and
`min()`. [Una Kravets](#) has a [great layout blog
post](https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/) about this, calling it
[RAM](https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/#07.-ram-(repeat-auto-minmax):-grid-template-columns(auto-fit-minmax(lessbasegreater-1fr))).

There's 3 special additions in our layout, if you compare it to Una's:

- We pass an extra `min()` function.
- We specify `align-items: flex-start`.
- There's a `max-width: 89vw` style.

The extra `min()` function is well described by Evan Minto on their blog in the
post [Intrinsically Responsive CSS Grid with minmax() and
min()](https://evanminto.com/blog/intrinsically-responsive-css-grid-minmax-min/).
I recommend giving that a read. The `flex-start` alignment correction is to
remove the default stretching effect, so that the children of this layout don't
need to have equal heights, they can have natural, intrinsic heights. The
YouTube video has a quick breakdown of this alignment addition.

`max-width: 89vw` is worth a small breakdown in this post. 
Let me show you the layout with and without the style applied:

{% Video 
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/gdldf7hyaBrHWwxQbSaT.mp4",
  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true" 
%}

What's happening? When `max-width` is specified, it's providing context,
explicit sizing or [definite
sizing](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#definite) for the [`auto-fit`
layout algorithm](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#auto-repeat) to know how
many repetitions it can fit into the space. While it seems obvious that the
space is "full width", per the CSS grid spec, a definite size or max-size must
be provided. I've provided a max-size.

So, why `89vw`? Because "it worked" for my layout. 
Me and a couple of other Chrome folks are investigating why a more reasonable value,
like `100vw` isn't sufficient, and if this is in fact a bug.

### Spacing

A majority of the harmony of this layout is from a limited palette of spacing, 7
to be exact. 

```css
:root {
  --space-xxs: .25rem;
  --space-xs:  .5rem;
  --space-sm:  1rem;
  --space-md:  1.5rem;
  --space-lg:  2rem;
  --space-xl:  3rem;
  --space-xxl: 6rem;
}
```

Usage of these flows really nicely with grid, [CSS @nest](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting-1/), and [level 5 syntax
of @media](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/). Here's an example, the fully `<main>` layout set of styles.

```css
main {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-xl);
  place-content: center;
  padding: var(--space-sm);

  @media (width >= 540px) {
    & { 
      padding: var(--space-lg); 
    }
  }

  @media (width >= 800px) {
    & { 
      padding: var(--space-xl); 
    }
  }
}
```

A grid with centered content, moderately padded by default (like on mobile). But
as more viewport space becomes available, it spreads out by increasing padding.
2021 CSS is looking pretty good!

Remember the earlier layout, "just for gap"? Here's a more complete version of
how they look in this component:

```css
header {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-xxs);
}

section {
  display: grid;
  gap: var(--space-md);
}
```

## Color

A controlled use of color helped this design stand out as expressive yet
minimal. I do it like this:

```css
:root {
  --surface1: lch(10 0 0);
  --surface2: lch(15 0 0);
  --surface3: lch(20 0 0);
  --surface4: lch(25 0 0);

  --text1: lch(95 0 0);
  --text2: lch(75 0 0);
}
```

{% Aside 'key-term' %} 
[PostCSS `lab()` and `lch()`
plugin](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-lab-function) is part of [PostCSS
Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#lch-function), and will output
`rgb()` colors. 
{% endAside %}

I name my surface and text colors with numbers as opposed to names like
`surface-dark` and `surface-darker` because in a media query, I'll be flipping
them, and light and dark won't be meaningful. 

I flip them in a preference media query like this:

```css
:root {
  ...

  @media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
    & {
      --surface1: lch(90 0 0);
      --surface2: lch(100 0 0);
      --surface3: lch(98 0 0);
      --surface4: lch(85 0 0);

      --text1: lch(20 0 0);
      --text2: lch(40 0 0);
    }
  }
}
```

[PostCSS `@nest` plugin](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-nesting) is part of [PostCSS
Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features), and will expand selectors to a syntax 
browsers support today. 
{% endAside %}

It's important to get a quick glimpse at the overall picture and strategy before
we dive into color syntax details. But, since I've gotten a bit ahead of myself,
let me back up a bit. 

### LCH?

Without getting too deep into color theory land, LCH is a human oriented syntax,
that caters to how we percieve color, not how we measure color with math (like
255). This gives it a distinct advantage as humans can write it more easily and other
humans will be in tune with these adjustments.

<figure class="w-figure w-screenshot">
  {% Img 
    src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/160dWLSrMhFISwWMVd4w.png", 
    alt="A screenshot of pod.link/csspodcast webpage, with Color 2: Perception episode pulled up", 
    width="800", 
    height="329" 
  %}
  <figcaption class="w-figure">
    Learn about perceptual color (and more!) on the <a href="https://pod.link/thecsspodcast">CSS Podcast</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

For today, in this demo, let's focus on the syntax and the values I'm flipping
to make light and dark. Let's look at 1 surface and 1 text color:

```css
:root {
  --surface1: lch(10 0 0);
  --text1:    lch(95 0 0);

  @media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
    & {
      --surface1: lch(90 0 0);
      --text1:    lch(40 0 0);
    }
  }
}
```

`--surface1: lch(10 0 0)` translates to `10%` lightness, 0 chroma and 0 hue: a
very dark colorless gray. Then, in the media query for light mode, the lightness
is flipped to `90%` with `--surface1: lch(90 0 0);`. And that's the gist of the
strategy. Start by just changing lightness between the 2 themes, maintaining the
contrast ratios the design calls for or what can maintain accessibility. 

The bonus with `lch()` here is that lightness is human oriented, and we can feel
good about a `%` change to it, that it will be perceptually and consistently
that `%` different. `hsl()` for example is [not as
reliable](https://twitter.com/argyleink/status/1201908189257555968).

There's [more to
learn](https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/) about
color spaces and `lch()` if you're interested. It's coming!

{% Blockquote 'Lea Verou' %} 
CSS right now **cannot access these colors at all**.
Let me repeat: **We have no access to one third of the colors in most modern
monitors.** And these are not just any colors, but the **most vivid colors the
screen can display**. Our websites are washed out because monitor hardware evolved
faster than CSS specs and browser implementations.
{% endBlockquote %}

### Adaptive form controls with color-scheme

Many browsers ship dark theme controls, currently Safari and Chromium, but you
have to specify in CSS or HTML that your design uses them.

{% Video 
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/0VVtEAWM6jHeIxahqnFy.mp4",
  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true" 
%}

The above is demonstrating the effect of the property from the Styles panel of
DevTools. The demo uses the HTML tag, which in my opinion is generally
a better location:

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">
```

Learn all about it in this [`color-scheme`
article](https://web.dev/color-scheme/) by [Thomas
Steiner](https://web.dev/authors/thomassteiner/). There's a lot more to gain
than dark checkbox inputs!

### CSS `accent-color`

There's been [recent
activity](https://twitter.com/argyleink/status/1360022120810483715?s=20) around
`accent-color` on form elements, being a single CSS style that can change the
tint color used in the browsers input element. Read more about it [here on
GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5187). I've included it in my
styles for this component. As browsers support it, my checkboxes will be
more on theme with the pink and purple color pops.

```css
input[type="checkbox"] {
  accent-color: var(--brand);
}
```

{% Img 
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/J9pbhB0ImoDzbsXkBGtG.png", 
  alt="A screenshot from Chromium on Linux of pink checkboxes", 
  width="800", 
  height="406" 
%}

### Color pops with fixed gradients and focus-within

Color pops most when it's used sparingly, and one of the ways I like to achieve
that is through colorful UI interactions. 

{% Video 
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/Pm75QwVToKkiqedqPtmm.mp4",
  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true",
  width="480px"
%}

There are many layers of UI feedback and interaction in the above video, which
help give personality to the interaction by:
- Highlighting context.
- Providing UI feedback of "how full" the value is in the range.
- Providing UI feedback that a field is accepting input.

To provide feedback when an element is being interacted with, CSS is using the
[`:focus-within`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within)
pseudo class to change the appearance of various elements, let's break down the
`.fieldset-item`, it's super interesting:

```css
.fieldset-item {
  ...
  
  &:focus-within {
    background: var(--surface2);

    & svg {
      fill: white;
    }

    & picture {
      clip-path: circle(50%);
      background: var(--brand-bg-gradient) fixed;
    }
  }
}
```

When one of the children of this element has focus-within:
1. The `.fieldset-item` background is assigned a higher contrast surface color.
1. The nested `svg` is filled white for higher contrast.
1. The nested `<picture>` `clip-path` expands to a full circle and the
   background is filled with the bright fixed gradient.

## Custom range

Given the following HTML input element, I'll show you how I customized its
appearance:

```html
<input type="range">
```

There's 3 parts to this element we need to customize:
1. [Range element / container](#range-element-styles)
1. [Track](#track-styles)
1. [Thumb](#thumb-styles)

### Range element styles
```css
input[type="range"] {
  /* style setting variables */
  --track-height: .5ex;
  --track-fill: 0%;
  --thumb-size: 3ex;
  --thumb-offset: -1.25ex;
  --thumb-highlight-size: 0px;

  appearance: none;         /* clear styles, make way for mine */
  display: block;
  inline-size: 100%;        /* fill container */
  margin: 1ex 0;            /* ensure thumb isn't colliding with sibling content */
  background: transparent;  /* bg is in the track */
  outline-offset: 5px;      /* focus styles have space */
}
```

The first few lines of CSS are the custom parts of the styles, and I hope that
clearly labeling them helps. The rest of the styles are mostly reset styles, to
provide a consistent foundation for building the tricky parts of the component.

### Track styles

```css
input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {
  appearance: none; /* clear styles, make way for mine */
  block-size: var(--track-height);
  border-radius: 5ex;
  background: 
    /* hard stop gradient: 
        - half transparent (where colorful fill we be)
        - half dark track fill
        - 1st background image is on top
    */
    linear-gradient(
      to right, 
      transparent var(--track-fill), 
      var(--surface1) 0%
    ),
    /* colorful fill effect, behind track surface fill */
    var(--brand-bg-gradient) fixed;
}
```

The trick to this is "revealing" the vibrant fill color. This is done with the
hard stop gradient on top. The gradient is transparent up to the fill percentage, and after
that uses the unfilled track surface color. Behind that unfilled surface, is a
full width color, waiting for transparency to reveal it.

{% Video 
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/aiAL28AkDRZvaAZNEbW8.mp4",
  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true" 
%}

#### Track fill style
My design **does require Javascript** in order to maintain the fill style. There
are CSS only strategies but they require the thumb element to be the same height
as the track, and I wasn't able to find a harmony within those limits.

```js
/* grab sliders on page */
const sliders = document.querySelectorAll('input[type="range"]')

/* take a slider element, return a percentage string for use in CSS */
const rangeToPercent = slider => {
  const max = slider.getAttribute('max') || 10;
  const percent = slider.value / max * 100;

  return `${parseInt(percent)}%`;
};

/* on page load, set the fill amount */
sliders.forEach(slider => {
  slider.style.setProperty('--track-fill', rangeToPercent(slider));

  /* when a slider changes, update the fill prop */
  slider.addEventListener('input', e => {
    e.target.style.setProperty('--track-fill', rangeToPercent(e.target));
  })
})
```

I think this makes for a nice visual upgrade. The slider works great without
Javascript, the `--track-fill` prop is not required, it simply will not have a
fill style if not present. If Javascript is available, populate the custom
property while also observing any user changes, syncing the custom property with
the value. 

[Here's a great
post](https://css-tricks.com/sliding-nightmare-understanding-range-input/) on
[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) by [Ana
Tudor](https://twitter.com/anatudor), that demonstrates a CSS only solution for
track fill. I also found this [Native UI
range](https://app.native-elements.dev/editor/elements/range) very inspiring.

### Thumb styles

```css
input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-thumb {
  appearance: none; /* clear styles, make way for mine */
  cursor: ew-resize; /* cursor style to support drag direction */
  border: 3px solid var(--surface3);
  block-size: var(--thumb-size);
  inline-size: var(--thumb-size);
  margin-top: var(--thumb-offset);
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: var(--brand-bg-gradient) fixed;
}
```

The majority of these styles are to make a nice circle. 
Again you see the fixed background gradient there that unifies the
dynamic colors of the thumbs, tracks and associated SVG elements.
I separated the styles for the interaction to help isolate the `box-shadow`
technique being used for the hover highlight:

```css
@custom-media --motionOK (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference);

::-webkit-slider-thumb {
  …

  /* shadow spread is initally 0 */
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 var(--thumb-highlight-size) var(--thumb-highlight-color);
  
  /* if motion is OK, transition the box-shadow change */
  @media (--motionOK) {
    & {
      transition: box-shadow .1s ease;
    }
  }

  /* on hover/active state of parent, increase size prop */
  @nest input[type="range"]:is(:hover,:active) & {
    --thumb-highlight-size: 10px;
  }
}
```

{% Aside 'key-term' %} 
[@custom-media](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#custom-mq) 
is a Level 5 spec addition that
[PostCSS Custom Media](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-media), part of
[PostCSS Preset Env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features). 
{% endAside %}

The goal was an easy to manage and animated visual highlight for user feedback.
By using a box shadow I can avoid [triggering
layout](https://web.dev/animations-guide/#triggers) with the effect. I do this
by creating a shadow that's not blurred and matches the circular shape of the
thumb element. Then I change and transition it's spread size on hover.

  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true" 
%}

If only the highlight effect was so easy on checkboxes…

### Cross browser selectors

I found I needed these `-webkit-` and `-moz-` selectors to achieve cross browser
consistency:

```css
input[type="range"] {
  &::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {}
  &::-moz-range-track {}
  &::-webkit-slider-thumb {}
  &::-moz-range-thumb {}
}
```

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} 
[Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) outlines
why the above examples don't simply use a comma between selectors for cross
browser styling, see the [Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1359213591602335752?s=20) for
more information. 
{% endAside %}

## Custom Checkbox

Given the following HTML input element, I'll show you how I customized its
appearance:

```html
<input type="checkbox">
```

There's 3 parts to this element we need to customize:
1. [Checkbox element](#checkbox-element)
1. [Associated labels](#checkbox-labels)
1. [Highlight effect](#checkbox-highlight)

### Checkbox element

```css
input[type="checkbox"] {
  inline-size: var(--space-sm);   /* increase width */
  block-size: var(--space-sm);    /* increase height */
  outline-offset: 5px;            /* focus style enhancement */
  accent-color: var(--brand);     /* tint the input */
  position: relative;             /* prepare for an absolute pseudo element */
  transform-style: preserve-3d;   /* create a 3d z-space stacking context */
  margin: 0;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

The `transform-style` and `position` styles prepare for the pseudo-element we will introduce later 
to style the highlight. Otherwise, it's mostly
minor opinionated style stuff from me. I like the cursor to be pointer, I like
outline offsets, default checkboxes are too tiny, and if `accent-color` is
[supported](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-4/#widget-accent), bring these
checkboxes into the brand color scheme.

### Checkbox labels

It's important to provide labels for checkboxes for 2 reasons. The first is to
represent what the checkbox value is used for, to answer "on or off for what?"
Second is for UX, web users have become accustomed to interacting with
checkboxes via their associated labels.

<label for="text-notifications">
  <h3>Text Messages</h3>
  <small>Get notified about all text messages sent to your device</small>
</label>
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

On your label, put a `for` attribute that points to a checkbox by ID: `<label
for="text-notifications">`. On your checkbox, double up both the name and id to
ensure it's found with varying tools and tech, like a mouse or screenreader:
`<input type="checkbox" id="text-notifications" name="text-notifications">`.
`:hover`, `:active` and more come for free with the connection, increasing the
ways your form can be interacted with.

### Checkbox highlight

I want to keep my interfaces consistent, and the slider element has a nice
thumbnail highlight that I'd like to use with the checkbox. The thumbnail was
able to use `box-shadow` and it's `spread` property to scale a shadow up and
down. However, that effect doesn't work here because our checkboxes are, [and should
be](https://twitter.com/argyleink/status/1329230409784291328?s=20), square.

I was able to achieve the same visual effect with a pseudo element, and an
unfortunate amount of tricky CSS:

```css
@custom-media --motionOK (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference);

input[type="checkbox"]::before {
  --thumb-scale: .01;                        /* initial scale of highlight */
  --thumb-highlight-size: var(--space-xl);

  content: "";
  inline-size: var(--thumb-highlight-size);
  block-size: var(--thumb-highlight-size);
  clip-path: circle(50%);                     /* circle shape */
  position: absolute;                         /* this is why position relative on parent */
  top: 50%;                                   /* pop and plop technique (https://web.dev/centering-in-css/#5.-pop-and-plop) */
  left: 50%;
  background: var(--thumb-highlight-color);
  transform-origin: center center;            /* goal is a centered scaling circle */
  transform:                                  /* order here matters!! */
    translateX(-50%)                          /* counter balances left: 50% */
    translateY(-50%)                          /* counter balances top: 50% */
    translateZ(-1px)                          /* PUTS IT BEHIND THE CHECKBOX */
    scale(var(--thumb-scale))                 /* value we toggle for animation */
  ;
  will-change: transform;

  @media (--motionOK) {                       /* transition only if motion is OK */
    & {
      transition: transform .2s ease;
    }
  }
}

/* on hover, set scale custom property to "in" state */
input[type="checkbox"]:hover::before {
  --thumb-scale: 1;
}
```

Creating a circle psuedo-element is straightforward work, but **placing it
behind the element it's attached to** was harder. Here's before and
after I fixed it:

{% Video 
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/Spdpw5P1MD8ceazneRXo.mp4",
  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true" 
%}

It's definitely a micro interaction, but important to me to keep the visual
consistency. The animation scaling technique is the same as we've been using in
other places. We set a custom property to a new value and let CSS transition it
based on motion preferences. The key feature here is `translateZ(-1px)`. The
parent created a 3D space and this pseudo-element child tapped into it by
placing itself slightly back in z-space.

## Accessibility

The YouTube video does a great demonstration of the mouse, keyboard and
screenreader interactions for this settings component. I'll call out some of the
details here.

### HTML Element Choices

```html
<form>
<header>
<fieldset>
<picture>
<label>
<input>
```

Each of these holds hints and tips to the user's browsing tool. Some elements
provide interaction hints, some connect interactivity, and some help shape the
acccessibility tree that a screenreader navigates. 

### HTML Attributes

We can hide elements that are not needed by screenreaders, 
in this case the icon next to the slider:

```html
<picture aria-hidden="true">
```

{% Video 
  src="video/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/fVjqHRZHQixAaxjeAvDP.mp4",
  className="w-screenshot", 
  autoplay="true", 
  loop="true", 
  muted="true",
  width="480px" 
%}

The above video demonstrates the screenreader flow on Mac OS. Notice how input
focus moves straight from one slider to the next. This is because we've hidden
the icon that may have been a stop on the way to the next slider. Without this
attribute, a user would need to stop, listen and move past the picture which
they may not be able to see.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %} 
Ensure to cross browser test screenreader interactions.
The original demo included `<label>` in the list of elements with
`aria-hidden="true"`, but it's been since removed after [Twitter
conversation](https://twitter.com/rob_dodson/status/1371859386210029568)
revealed cross browser differences. 
{% endAside %}

The SVG is a bunch of math, let's add a `<title>` element for a free mouse hover
title and a human readable comment about what the math is creating:

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <title>A note icon</title>
  <path d="M12 3v10.55c-.59-.34-1.27-.55-2-.55-2.21 0-4 1.79-4 4s1.79 4 4 4 4-1.79 4-4V7h4V3h-6z"/>
</svg>
```

Other than that, we've used enough clearly marked HTML, that the form tests
really well across mouse, keyboard, video game controllers and screenreaders.

## JavaScript

I've [already covered](#track-styles) how the track fill color was being managed from JavaScript,
so let's look at the `<form>` related JavaScript now:

```js
const form = document.querySelector('form');

form.addEventListener('input', event => {
  const formData = Object.fromEntries(new FormData(form));
  console.table(formData);
})
```

Everytime the form is interacted with and changed, the console logs the form as
an object into a table for easy review before submitting to a server.

{% Img
  src="image/vS06HQ1YTsbMKSFTIPl2iogUQP73/hFAyIOpOSdiczdf4AtIj.png",
  alt="A screenshot of the console.table() results, where the form data is shown in a table",
  class="w-screenshot",
  width="800", height="285"
%}

## Conclusion

Now that you know how I did it, how would you?! This makes for some fun
component architecture! Who's going to make the 1st version with slots in their
favorite framework? 🙂
