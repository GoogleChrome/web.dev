This page provides guidance to help ensure your website is available,
accessible, secure, and usable for everyone at all times.

{% Aside %} If you're building or maintaining a health organization website
that qualifies as a national health ministry or US state-level agency, you can
request to join the COVID-19 Google Search technical support group. Visit
[Helping health organizations make COVID-19 information more
accessible](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/03/health-organizations-covid19.html)
to learn more. {% endAside %}

The guidance on this page comes from a cross-functional collection of teams
within Google that are shifting their short-term focus to support websites that are
helping people stay safe during the COVID-19 situation. These Googlers have seen that sites
are facing unprecedented increases in demand from people looking for critical
information, many of whom have rarely or never used the web before. It can be a challenge
to ensure sites are available during this time and accessible to all.

## Guidance {: #guidance }

{% Aside %}
  This guidance is a work in progress and will be updated frequently.
  If you have any suggestions, please [file an
  issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/issues/new/choose), or [edit
  this page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/blob/master/src/site/content/en/blog/covid19/index.md)
  and then open a pull request.
{% endAside %}

### Availability, reliability, resilience, and stability {: #availability }

If your site is seeing traffic spikes and it's failing, or you want to prevent it
from failing, the guidance below can help you quickly fix problems or detect them
before they become major issues.

* Read [Fix an overloaded server](/overloaded-server) to learn
  how to detect, mitigate, and prevent traffic spike issues.
* Remove unnecessary images, videos, scripts, and fonts. Ensure each page focuses
  on just delivering the functionality that the people using your site really
  need.
* [Optimizing your images](/fast/#optimize-your-images) may
  significantly reduce your server bandwidth usage because [images are the
  number one source of bloat on the web](https://images.guide/#introduction).
* Offload as much of your static content to CDNs as possible.
  More details from common providers:
  [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/),
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cdn/),
  [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/),
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/cdn),
  [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).
* Check if your CDN has any optimizations that are easy to turn on, such as
  dynamic image compression, text compression, or automatic minification of JS
  and CSS resources.
* Optimizing HTTP caching can significantly reduce demands on your servers with
  minimal code change. Check out [The HTTP cache: your first line of
  defense](/http-cache/) for an overview and [HTTP
  caching](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching)
  and [Caching best
  practices](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/) for
  specific recommendations. The [Serve static assets with an efficient cache
  policy](/uses-long-cache-ttl/) audit in Lighthouse can help you
  quickly detect resources that aren't being cached. Keep in mind that different
  types of resources will have different freshness requirements and will
  therefore require different caching strategies.
* [Service workers](/service-workers-cache-storage/) are another
  way to significantly reduce demands on your servers but may require significant technical
  investment. They also enable your website to work
  [offline](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/offline),
  enabling you to present opening hours, phone numbers, and other information to
  returning users without a connection. [Workbox](/workbox/) is
  the recommended approach for adding service workers to websites because it
  automates a lot of boilerplate, makes it easier to follow best practices, and
  prevents subtle bugs that are common when using the low-level `ServiceWorker`
  API directly.
* If your site is seeing major increased usage, check whether you have adequate
  protection against [DDoS
  attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) because your
  site may now be a more attractive target. More details from common providers:
  [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-ddos-attack-mitigation/),
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/ddos-protection/),
  [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/),
  [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/files/GCPDDoSprotection-04122016.pdf).

See [Network reliability](/reliable/) for more guidance.

### Accessibility {: #accessibility }

Focusing on accessibility is more important than ever because more people with a
variety of needs are probably accessing your site. Follow the guidelines below
to ensure that the core functionality of your website is accessible for
everyone.

* Accessibility is a team effort and everyone has a role to play. Start by
  reviewing Google's [Accessibility for Teams
  guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/a11y-for-teams)
  as well as [the team guide from the U.S. Digital
  Service](https://accessibility.digital.gov/). These guides explain what each
  team member (product managers, engineers, designers, QA, and so on) can
  contribute.
* Do an [Accessibility
  Review](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review)
  to determine what's working well, and what needs improvement.
  The [WAVE browser extensions](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) can help
  guide you through a manual accessibility audit of your site.
* Read through the [Accessibility Guides](/accessible) to better understand
  specific topics like keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
* [Run a Lighthouse
  audit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) to catch
  common accessibility issues. The report also provides a list of manual checks
  that you can perform to improve the operability of your site. Note that an
  Accessibility score of 100 does not guarantee that your site is accessible. There
  are many important issues that Lighthouse can't test for in an automated
  fashion so it's still important to do manual reviews. Other automated auditing
  tools include the [WAVE API](https://wave.webaim.org/api/) and the [AXE
  extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd).
* Complete the [Start Building Accessible Web Applications Today course
  on
  egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/start-building-accessible-web-applications-today)
  course or check out the [Web Accessibility course on
  Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891).
* Watch the [A11ycast
  playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g)
  for more quick tips on specific accessibility topics.

### Identity, security, and privacy {: #PII }

It can be tempting to take shortcuts to get critical fixes out the door, but
always be careful that you are not opening up security holes in doing so. People
need to access content on topics that are extremely private. Websites need to
protect this sensitive user data at all costs and convince people that their
[personally identifiable
information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) (PII) is safe.

* Understand [why all websites should be protected with
  HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https),
  not just those that handle sensitive PII data.
* Switch to a hosting provider that uses HTTPS by default, or use [Let's
  Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) or similar services to
  enable HTTPS on your servers.
* Review [SameSite cookies explained](/samesite-cookies-explained/) to learn
  how to make your use of cookies more secure. Note that
  [the enforcement of SameSite cookie labeling has been temporarily rolled back](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/temporarily-rolling-back-samesite.html).

See [Safe and secure](/secure/) for more guidance.

### Usability, UI, and UX {: #usability }

People are relying more heavily on the web to fulfill basic needs. Many of these
people don't use the web frequently. It's worthwhile to audit the usability of
your site's core functionality and make sure it's as simple and easy to use as
possible.

* Consider adding a prominent banner (that can be removed with an **X** button)
  to the top of your website that clearly communicates service updates. Use a
  call-to-action in the banner to direct people to more specific resources.
  Consider using distinct colors and fonts that stand out from the rest of your
  page content. Keep your writing empathetic, focused on people's needs, and
  transparent about what kind of service to expect.
* Look for opportunities to minimize physical interactions in your [critical
  user journeys](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/journey-mapping-101/) (CUJs)
  and suggest those changes to your product team. For example, if your delivery
  service usually requires a signature, see if there's any way to work around
  that.
* Double-check that your CUJs are as simple and intuitive as possible and
  suggest changes to your product team if you see any opportunities to improve.
* Review the [principles of good mobile
  design](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/principles)
  and try out your CUJs on various mobile devices to make sure there aren't any
  glaring issues. The people who don't use the web often and are suddenly finding
  themselves having to rely on the web more are probably accessing your site from
  mobile devices.
* Refactor your site to use [responsive design
  patterns](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive)
  as much as possible.
* Ensure that your forms are
  [efficient](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/designing-efficient-web-forms/)
  and
  [well-designed](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/input/forms).

### SEO {: #seo }

People are looking for critical health- and job-related information. It's
important to ensure that your sites are discoverable by all search engines.
The [Lighthouse SEO audits](/lighthouse-seo/) can help you detect basic problems.
Follow the official blogs of search engines for the latest guidance and updates:
[Google](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/),
[Bing](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/),
[Baidu](http://research.baidu.com/Blog),
[DuckDuckGo](https://spreadprivacy.com/tag/duckduckgo/),
[Yandex](https://yandex.com/blog/yacompany-com).

### Performance {: #performance }

Some ISPs ([in India for
example](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/brace-yourself-for-slower-data-speeds/articleshow/74702264.cms))
are seeing a [sharp increase in home internet
usage](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/817154787/internet-traffic-surges-as-companies-and-schools-send-people-home)
and don't have the infrastructure to meet the increased demand. In situations
like this your website speed may be getting slower through no fault of your own.
Optimizing your load performance could be a way to offset the headwind of
reduced bandwidth. In other words, by reducing the number of bytes that need to
be sent over the network in order to load your pages, you can offset the
performance impact of reduced bandwidth.

* Images are the [number one cause of bloat on the
  web](https://images.guide/#introduction). You might be able to significantly
  reduce your website's bandwidth usage by [optimizing your
  images](/fast/#optimize-your-images).
  [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) is a simple open source image compression tool
  that can help you quickly compress your images.
* Run [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/easy) or
  [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#get-started)
  to discover your top performance improvement opportunities.
* [Enable text compression](/uses-text-compression/) to reduce
  the network size of text resources. This is often an easy performance win that
  requires minimal technical investment.
* Read [Fixing website speed
  cross-functionally](/fixing-website-speed-cross-functionally/)
  to learn how to collaborate with and get buy-in from other departments.
* [Use standardized lazy-loading for images](/native-lazy-loading/) to
  minimize requests for images that people may never actually see. [Browser
  compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Browser_compatibility)
  is not 100% but the feature can be treated as a progressive enhancement. In
  other words, if a certain browser doesn't support standardized lazy-loading, the
  image should load as it normally does.
* Check if your site has any A/B testing or personalization scripts that can be
  loaded more asynchronously or if there's any non-critical functionality in the
  scripts that can be disabled. A/B testing and personalization scripts usually
  can't be loaded *completely* asynchronously because they need to run before
  the page content loads, but there may be some opportunity to load parts of the
  scripts more asynchronously. See [Critical Rendering Path][crp] to understand
  the fundamental tradeoff between synchronous scripts (also known as
  render-blocking scripts) in general and page load time, and then decide
  whether you need to prioritize the render-blocking scripts over page load
  time, or vice versa.
* Third-party code constitutes [around half of all
  requests](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/third-parties) for most
  websites. Consider
  [optimizing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript)
  or temporarily removing or disabling third-party code that isn't fundamental
  to running your site.
* If feature releases are deprioritized, this might be the perfect time to clean
  up. Remove tags from your tag managers, clean up bloated CSS and JS, and
  remove deprecated features or code. The
  [Coverage tab](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage)
  in Chrome DevTools and the
  [`Coverage`](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v2.1.1&show=api-class-coverage) class
  in Puppeteer can help you detect unused code.
