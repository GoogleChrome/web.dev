[Blibli](https://www.blibli.com/) is a well known e-commerce marketplace in
Indonesia. The company had over 29 million average monthly website visits in
2019. In a recent study, Blibli's web team found that their mobile web platform
is a significant visitor and user acquisition platform, with 70% of web users
landing on mobile and 30% of web users landing on desktop.

With that insight, Blibli embarked on a journey to develop a better web
experience and improve conversions. As a result, they were able to achieve some
exceptional results:

## Highlighting the opportunity

Blibli identified the following areas of opportunities:

+   For Blibli, the mobile web platform was important for user
    acquisition with many users on mid- to low- tier devices.
+   Indonesia's internet economy was
    [expanding rapidly beyond Tier 1 cities](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-economy-sea.appspot.com/assets/pdf/Indonesia-e-Conomy_SEA_2020_Country_Insights.pdf).
    Hence, PWA and fast pages were a good investment to support user needs like
    limited storage and slow networks.
+   50% of users that are coming to the Blibli web platform are returning users.

## The approach they used

The team took a staged strategy of short- to medium-term improvements on the
mobile web platform. This included:

+   Performance optimized website including a UX revamped [home
    page](https://www.blibli.com)
+   A lite version of home page for new users with a
    [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers)
    to cache critical assets for subsequent navigation
+   [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) for
    returning users

### User flow

<td>New visitors are presented with a lightweight page which is<strong> 3x
faster</strong> compared to the old home page</td>
<td>On subsequent pages, Blibli proposes users to add the<strong> PWA shortcut
to their home screen</strong></td>
<td>If the user loses network connection, users are presented with an<strong>
elegant offline fallback page</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Blibli's lite page created a first impression that Blibli.com is fast and
responsive. Moreover, the lite page streamlined the number of features by only
focusing on those that deliver the value proposition of Blibli.

Blibli's PWA is installable, giving it a native like look and feel. It is also
fast and reliable which was achieved using service worker caching and graceful
offline fallback.

This comes as a delight for web users, a large proportion of who use mid-tier
devices. Since Blibli's PWA is even less than 1MB in size (that's a whopping 24x
lighter than their Android app!), there is much less friction for users to
install it. It also makes it easier for Blibli to retain users while providing
them with a seamless native like experience.

### Set performance budgets

Blibli made performance budgeting as a performance standard within the tech
development and management, where the standard was reviewed on a regular basis
and to be set as the KPI of internal tech development, along with the guidance
of top management to ensure the best platform for all of our users.

## Overall business results

+   3x reduction in page load times
+   42% reduction in bounce rates
+   8x Better mobile conversion rates in installed PWA compared to browser
    mobile web
+   2.5x more pages/sessions on installed PWA
+   10x more revenue per user compared to the previous mobile website

"Speed and PWA were a valuable investment for us to provide the best mobile
experience and representing our mission, to deliver the best platform for our
users"
