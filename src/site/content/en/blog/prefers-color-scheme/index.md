## Background

</figure>

We have gone full circle with dark mode.
In the dawn of personal computing, dark mode wasn't a deliberate choice,
but purely a matter of fact:
Monochrome Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) computer monitors work by firing electron beams
on a phosphorescent screen, and as the phosphor that these early CRTs used was green,
they were oftentimes referred to as
[green screens](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schneider_CPC6128_with_green_monitor_GT65,_start_screen.jpg).
Information like text was displayed in green, and the rest of the screen was black.

  <img style="height:175px; width:auto;" src="word-processing.jpg" alt="Dark-on-white word processing" intrinsicsize="698x551">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">Fig. 2 — Dark-on-white (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKkABzt0Zqg">Source</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

The subsequently introduced Color CRTs display multiple colors
through the use of red, green, and blue phosphors.
They create white by activating all three phosphors simultaneously.
With the advent of more sophisticated *What You See Is What You Get* (WYSIWYG)
[desktop publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing),
the idea of making the document resemble a physical sheet of paper became popular.
This is where *dark-on-white* as a design trend started,
and this trend was carried over to the document-based web.
To the present day, web pages and apps are typically designed with dark text on a light background,
a baseline assumption that is also hard-coded in User-Agent (UA) stylesheets like
[Chrome's](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/master/Source/core/css/html.css).

Today, a lot of content consumption and creation has shifted to mobile devices
that use backlit Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
or energy-saving Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (AMOLED) screens,
and on the desktop as well (which can be a full PC or a laptop), the days of CRTs are long over.
With such smaller and more transportable computers, tablets, and smartphones,
new usage patterns have evolved, like people using their devices in their beds at night-time;
and tasks like coding or high-end gaming frequently happen after-hours in dim environments anyway.
The more people use their devices in the dark, and even more since Apple has introduced
[Dark Mode in macOS Mojave](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208976) on the desktop,
the idea of going back to the roots of *light-on-dark* is becoming increasingly popular again.

## Why Dark Mode

When people get asked
[why they like or want dark mode](https://medium.com/dev-channel/let-there-be-darkness-maybe-9facd9c3023d),
the most popular response is that *"it's easier on the eyes,"*
followed by *"it's elegant and beautiful."*
Apple in their
[Dark Mode developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface)
explicitly write: *"The choice of whether to enable a light or dark appearance
is an aesthetic one for most users, and might not relate to ambient lighting conditions."*

</figure>

However, there're also people who actually need dark mode or other accessibility tools,
for example, users with low vision.
The earliest occurrence of such a tool I could find is
[System&nbsp;7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7)'s *CloseView* feature that had a toggle for
*"Black on White"* and *"White on Black,"* which arguably can be called dark mode.
While System&nbsp;7 supported color, the default user interface was still black-and-white.
You can actually
experience System&nbsp;7 live thanks to the
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/mac_MacOS_7.0.1_compilation)
(unfortunately the *CloseView* feature was on a separate floppy disk not part of the emulation).
These inversion-based implementations showed their weaknesses the moment color was introduced.
User research by Szpiro *et al.* on
[how people with low vision access computing devices](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2982168)
showed that all interviewed users disliked inverted images, however,
that many preferred light text on a dark background.
On its mobile devices, Apple accommodates for this shortcoming with a feature called
[Smart Invert](https://www.apple.com//accessibility/iphone/vision/)
that reverses the colors on the display, except for images, media,
and some apps that use dark color styles.

Computer Vision Syndrome, also known as Digital Eye Strain, is
[defined](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00834.x)
as *"the combination of eye and vision problems associated with the use of computers
(including desktop, laptop and tablets) and other electronic displays (e.g.
smartphones and electronic reading devices)."*
It has been [proposed](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/1/e006748)
that the use of electronic devices by adolescents, particularly at night time,
leads to an increased risk of shorter sleep duration,
longer sleep-onset latency, and increased sleep deficiency.
Additionally, exposure to blue light has been widely
[reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4254760/)
to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm and the sleep cycle,
and irregular light environments may lead to sleep deprivation,
possibly affecting mood and task performance, according to
[Rosenfield](https://www.college-optometrists.org/oip-resource/computer-vision-syndrome--a-k-a--digital-eye-strain.html).
To limit these negative effects, limiting blue light by adjusting the display color temperature
through features like iOS' [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207570) or Android's
[Night Light](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7169926?) can help,
as well as avoiding bright lights or irregular lights in general through dark themes or dark modes.

## Activating Dark Mode in the Operation System

Now that I have covered the background of why dark mode is such a big thing,
let me go into detail how you can support it.
Before we dive into this, let's first clarify how people can activate dark mode in the first place.
Operating systems that support a dark mode or theme
typically have an option to activate it somewhere in the settings.
On macOS&nbsp;X, it's in the system preference's *General* section and called *Apprearance*,
and on Windows&nbsp;10 it's in the *Colors* section and called *Choose your color*.
For Android&nbsp;Q, you can find it under *Display* as a *Dark Theme* toggle switch.

## The `prefers-color-scheme` Media Query

[Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
allow authors to test and query values or features of the user agent or display device,
independent of the document being rendered.
They are used in the CSS `@media` rule to conditionally apply styles to a document,
and in various other contexts and languages, such as HTML and JavaScript.
[Media Queries Level&nbsp;5](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/)
introduces so-called user preference media features, that is,
a way for sites to detect the user's preferred way to display content.

{% Aside 'note' %}
  An established user preference media feature is `prefers-reduced-motion`
  that lets you detect the desire for less motion on a page.
  If you're interested, I have written about
  [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/03/prefers-reduced-motion)
  before.
{% endAside %}

The `prefers-color-scheme` media feature is used to detect
if the user has requested the page to use a light or dark color theme.
It takes the following values:

- `no-preference`:
  Indicates that the user has made no preference known to the system.
  This keyword value evaluates as false in the
  [boolean context](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#boolean-context).
- `light`:
  Indicates that the user has notified the system that they prefer a page that has a light theme
  (dark text on light background).
- `dark`:
  Indicates that the user has notified the system that they prefer a page that has a dark theme
  (light text on dark background).

## Supporting Dark Mode

Let's finally see how supporting dark mode looks in practice.
To optimize load speed, I have split my CSS into three parts:

- `style.css` that contains generic styles that are used universally on the site.
- `dark.css` that contains only the rules needed for dark mode.
- `light.css` that contains only the rules needed for light mode.

The two latter ones are loaded conditionally with a `<link media>` query.
Not all browsers will support this media query quite yet,
which I counter by loading the default `light.css` file via `document.write`
in a minuscule inline script.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script>
  // If `prefers-color-scheme` is not supported, fall back to light mode.
  // In this case, the file will be downloaded with `highest` priority.
  if (!window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme)').matches) {
    document.write('<link rel="stylesheet" href="/light.css"">');
  }
</script>
<!-- The main stylesheet -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
<!--
  Conditionally either load the light or the dark stylesheet. The matching file
  will be downloaded with `highest`, the non-matching file with `lowest`
  priority. If the browser doesn't support `prefers-color-scheme`, the media
  query is unknown and the files are downloaded with `lowest` priority (but
  above I force `highest` for the default experience).
-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dark.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/light.css" media="(prefers-color-scheme: no-preference), (prefers-color-scheme: light)">
```

I make maximum use of [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var),
this allows my generic `style.css` to be, well, generic,
and all the customization happens in the two other files `dark.css` and `light.css`.
Below you can see an excerpt of the actual styles, but it should suffice to convey the overall idea.
I declare two variables, `--background-color` and `--color`
that essentially create a *dark-on-light* and a *light-on-dark* baseline theme.

```css
/* light.css */
:root {
  --background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);
  --color: rgb(5, 5, 5);
}
```

```css
/* dark.css */
:root {
  --background-color: rgb(5, 5, 5);
  --color: rgb(250, 250, 250);
}
```

In my `style.css`, I then use these variables in the `body { … }` rule.
You will also have noticed a property `color-scheme` with the space-separated value `light dark`.

{% Aside 'note' %}
  Read up more on
  [what `color-scheme` actually does](https://medium.com/dev-channel/what-does-dark-modes-supported-color-schemes-actually-do-69c2eacdfa1d).
{% endAside %}

This tells the browser which color themes my app supports,
and allows it to activate special variants of the User Agent stylesheet.
This is useful to, for example, let the browser render form fields
with a dark background and light text, or to enable a theme-aware highlight color.

```css
/* style.css */
:root {
  color-scheme: dark light;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  color: var(--color);
}
```

In the following [Glitch](https://dark-mode-baseline.glitch.me/) embed,
you can see a more complete example that puts the concepts from above into practice.

<div style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media"
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/dark-mode-baseline?path=style.css&previewSize=100&attributionHidden=true"
    style="height:100%; width:100%; border:0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

When you play with this example, you can see
why I load my `dark.css` and `light.css` via media queries.
Try toggling dark mode and reload the page:
the particular currently non-matching stylesheets are still loaded, but with lowest priority,
so that they never compete with resources that are needed by the site right now.

## Dark Mode Best Practices

### Photographic images

If you compare the two screenshots above, you will notice that not only the core theme has changed
from *dark-on-light* to *light-on-dark*, but that also the hero image looks slightly different.
My [research](https://medium.com/dev-channel/re-colorization-for-dark-mode-19e2e17b584b)
has shown that the majority of the surveyed people
prefer slightly less vibrant and brilliant images when dark mode is active.
I refer to this as *re-colorization*.
Re-colorization can be achieved through a CSS filter on my images.
I use a CSS selector that matches all images that don't have `.svg` in their URL,
the idea being that I can give vector graphics (icons) a different re-colorization treatment
than my images (photos), more about this in the [next paragraph](#vector-graphics-and-icons).
Note how I again use a [CSS variable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var),
so I can later on flexibly change my filter.

{% Aside 'note' %}
  Read up more on
  [user research regarding re-colorization preferences with dark mode](https://medium.com/dev-channel/re-colorization-for-dark-mode-19e2e17b584b).
{% endAside %}

```css
/* dark.css */
--image-filter: grayscale(50%);

img:not([src*=".svg"]) {
  filter: var(--image-filter);
}
```

Not everyone is the same and people have different dark mode needs.
By sticking to the re-colorization method described above,
I can easily make the grayscale intensity a user preference that I can change via JavaScript.

```js
const filter = 'grayscale(70%)';
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--image-filter', value);
```

### Vector graphics and icons

For vector graphics—that in my case are used as icons—I use a different re-colorization method.
While [research](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2982168) has shown
that people don't like inversion for photos, it works very well for most icons.
Again I use CSS variables to determine the inversion amount
in the regular and in the `:hover` state.
Note how I only invert icons in `dark.css` but not in `light.css`, and how the `:hover` state
gets a different inversion intensity in the two cases to make the icon appear
slightly darker or slightly brighter, dependent on the mode the user has selected.

```css
/* dark.css */
--icon-filter: invert(100%);
--icon-filter_hover: invert(40%);

img[src*=".svg"] {
  filter: var(--icon-filter);
}
```

```css
/* light.css */
--icon-filter_hover: invert(60%);
```

```css
/* style.css */
img[src*=".svg"]:hover {
  filter: var(--icon-filter_hover);
}
```
