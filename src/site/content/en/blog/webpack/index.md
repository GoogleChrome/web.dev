Modern web applications often use a **bundling tool** to create a production
"bundle" of files (scripts, stylesheets, etc.) that is
[optimized](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/javascript-startup-optimization),
[minified](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer)
and can be downloaded in less time by your users. In **Web Performance
Optimization with webpack**, we will walk through how to effectively optimize
site resources using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). This can help users
load and interact with your sites more quickly.

webpack is one of the most popular bundling tools in use today. Taking advantage
of its features for optimizing modern code,
[code-splitting](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/webpack/use-long-term-caching#lazy-loading)
scripts into critical and non-critical pieces and stripping out unused code (to
name but a few optimizations) can ensure your app has a minimal network and
processing cost.

We created a training app to play with optimizations described in this
article. Try squeezing the most out of it to practice the tips:

Let’s get started by looking at optimizing one of the costliest resources in a
modern app – JavaScript.
