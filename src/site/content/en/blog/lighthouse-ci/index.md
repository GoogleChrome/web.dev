[Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) is a suite of
tools for using Lighthouse during continuous integration. Lighthouse CI can be
incorporated into developer workflows in many different ways. This guide covers
the following topics:

*   Using the Lighthouse CI CLI.
*   Configuring your CI provider to run Lighthouse CI.
*   Setting up a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) and
    [status
    check](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks)
    for Lighthouse CI. This will automatically display Lighthouse results on
    GitHub pull requests.
*   Building a performance dashboard and data store for Lighthouse reports.


## Overview

Lighthouse CI is a suite of free tools that facilitate using Lighthouse for
performance monitoring. A single Lighthouse report provides a snapshot of a web
page's performance at the time that it is run; Lighthouse CI shows how these
findings have changed over time. This can be used to identify the impact of
particular code changes or ensure that performance thresholds are met during
continuous integration processes. Although performance monitoring is the most
common use case for Lighthouse CI, it can be used to monitor other aspects of
the Lighthouse report - for example, SEO or accessibility.

The core functionality of Lighthouse CI is provided by the Lighthouse CI command
line interface. (Note: This is a separate tool than the [Lighthouse
CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#using-the-node-cli).) The
Lighthouse CI CLI provides a set of
[commands](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#commands)
for using Lighthouse CI. For example, the `autorun` command executes multiple
Lighthouse runs, identifies the median Lighthouse report, and uploads the report
for storage. This behavior can be heavily customized by passing additional flags
or customizing Lighthouse CI's configuration file, `lighthouserc.js`.

Although the core functionality of Lighthouse CI is primarily encapsulated in
the Lighthouse CI CLI, Lighthouse CI is typically used through one of the
following approaches:

*   Running Lighthouse CI as part of continuous integration
*   Using a Lighthouse CI GitHub Action that runs and comments on every pull
    request
*   Tracking performance over time via the dashboard provided by Lighthouse
    Server.

All of these approaches are built upon the Lighthouse CI CLI.

Alternatives to Lighthouse CI include third-party performance monitoring
services or writing your own script to collect performance data during the CI
process. You should consider using a third-party service if you'd prefer to let
someone else handle the management of your performance monitoring server and
test devices, or, if you want notification capabilities (such as email or Slack
integration) without having to build these features yourself.

## Use Lighthouse CI locally {: #cli }

This section explains how to run and install the Lighthouse CI CLI locally and
how to configure `lighthouserc.js`. Running the Lighthouse CI CLI locally is the
easiest way to make sure that your `lighthouserc.js` is configured correctly.

1.  Install the Lighthouse CI CLI.

    ```shell
    npm install -g @lhci/cli
    ```

    Lighthouse CI is configured by placing a `lighthouserc.js` file in the root of
    your project's repo. This file is mandatory and will contain Lighthouse CI
    related configuration information. Although Lighthouse CI can be [configured to
    be used without a git
    repo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#build-context),
    the instructions in this article assume that your project repo is configured to
    use git.

2.  In the root of your repository, create a `lighthouserc.js` [configuration
    file](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/v0.4.1/docs/configuration.md#configuration-file).

    ```shell
    touch lighthouserc.js
    ```

3.  Add the following code to `lighthouserc.js`. This code is an empty
    Lighthouse CI configuration. You will be adding to this configuration in
    later steps.

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      ci: {
        collect: {
          /* Add configuration here */
        },
        upload: {
          /* Add configuration here */
        },
      },
    };
    ```

4.  Every time that Lighthouse CI runs, it starts a server to serve your site.
    This server is what enables Lighthouse to load your site even when no other
    servers are running. When Lighthouse CI finishes running, it will
    automatically shutdown the server. To ensure that serving works correctly,
    you should configure either the
    [`staticDistDir`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#detecting-collectstaticdistdir)
    or
    [`startServerCommand`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/v0.4.1/docs/configuration.md#startservercommand)
    properties.

    If your site is static, add the `staticDistDir` property to the `ci.collect`
    object to indicate where your static files are located. Lighthouse CI will
    use its own server to serve these files while testing your site. If your
    site is not static, add the `startServerCommand` property to the
    `ci.collect` object to indicate the command that starts your server.
    Lighthouse CI will start a new server process during testing and shut it
    down after.

    ```js
    // Static site example
    collect: {
      staticDistDir: './public',
    }
    ```

    ```js
    // Dynamic site example
    collect: {
      startServerCommand: 'npm run start',
    }
    ```

5.  Add the
    [`url`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#url)
    property to the `ci.collect` object to indicate URL(s) that Lighthouse CI
    should run Lighthouse against. The value of the `url` property should be
    provided as an array of URLs; this array can contain one or more URLs. By
    default, Lighthouse CI will run Lighthouse three times against each URL.

    ```js
    collect: {
      // ...
      url: ['http://localhost:8080']
    }
    ```

    Note: These URLs should be serveable by the server you configured in the
    previous step. Thus, if you're running Lighthouse CI locally, these URLs should
    probably include `localhost` rather than your production host.

6.  Add the
    [`target`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#target)
    property to the `ci.upload` object and set the value to
    `'temporary-public-storage'`. The Lighthouse report(s) collected by
    Lighthouese CI will be uploaded to temporary public storage. The report will
    remain there for seven days and then be automatically deleted. This setup
    guide uses the "temporary public storage" upload option because it is quick
    to setup. For information on other ways of storing Lighthouse reports, refer
    to the
    [documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#target).

    ```js
    upload: {
      target: 'temporary-public-storage',
    }
    ```

    The storage location of the report will be similar to this: 

    ```text
    https://storage.googleapis.com/lighthouse-infrastructure.appspot.com/reports/1580152437799-46441.report.html
    ```

    (This URL won't work because the report has already been deleted.)

7.  Run the Lighthouse CI CLI from the terminal using the `autorun` command.
    This will run Lighthouse three times and upload the median Lighthouse
    report.

    ```shell
    lhci autorun
    ```

    If you've correctly configured Lighthouse CI, running this command should
    produce output similar to this:

    ```shell
    ✅  .lighthouseci/ directory writable
    ✅  Configuration file found
    ✅  Chrome installation found
    ⚠️   GitHub token not set
    Healthcheck passed!

    Started a web server on port 65324...
    Running Lighthouse 3 time(s) on http://localhost:65324/index.html
    Run #1...done.
    Run #2...done.
    Run #3...done.
    Done running Lighthouse!

    Uploading median LHR of http://localhost:65324/index.html...success!
    Open the report at https://storage.googleapis.com/lighthouse-infrastructure.appspot.com/reports/1591720514021-82403.report.html
    No GitHub token set, skipping GitHub status check.

    Done running autorun.
    ```

    You can ignore the `GitHub token not set` message in the console output. A
    GitHub token is only necessary if you want to use Lighthouse CI with a GitHub
    Action. How to setup a GitHub Action is explained later in this article. 

    Clicking on the link in the output that begins with
    `https://storage.googleapis.com...` will take you to the Lighthouse report
    corresponding to the median Lighthouse run.

    The defaults used by `autorun` can be overridden via the command line or
    `lighthouserc.js`. For example, the `lighthouserc.js` configuration below
    indicates that five Lighthouse runs should be collected every time `autorun`
    executes.

8.  Update `lighthouserc.js` to use the `numberOfRuns` property:
  
    ```js
    module.exports = {
        // ...
        collect: {
          numberOfRuns: 5
        },
      // ...
      },
    };
    ```
    
9.  Re-run the `autorun` command:

    ```shell
    lhci autorun
    ```

    The terminal output should show that Lighthouse has been run five times rather
    than the default three:

    ```shell
    ✅  .lighthouseci/ directory writable
    ✅  Configuration file found
    ✅  Chrome installation found
    ⚠️   GitHub token not set
    Healthcheck passed!

    Automatically determined ./dist as `staticDistDir`.
    Set it explicitly in lighthouserc.json if incorrect.

    Started a web server on port 64444...
    Running Lighthouse 5 time(s) on http://localhost:64444/index.html
    Run #1...done.
    Run #2...done.
    Run #3...done.
    Run #4...done.
    Run #5...done.
    Done running Lighthouse!

    Uploading median LHR of http://localhost:64444/index.html...success!
    Open the report at https://storage.googleapis.com/lighthouse-infrastructure.appspot.com/reports/1591716944028-6048.report.html
    No GitHub token set, skipping GitHub status check.

    Done running autorun.
    ```

    To learn about other configuration options, refer to the Lighthouse CI
    [configuration
    documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).

## Setup your CI process to run Lighthouse CI {: #ci-setup }

Lighthouse CI can be used with your favorite CI tool. The [Configure Your CI
Provider](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#configure-your-ci-provider)
section of the Lighthouse CI documentation contains code samples showing how to
incorporate Lighthouse CI into the configuration files of common CI tools.
Specifically, these code samples show how to run Lighthouse CI to collect
performance measurements during the CI process.

Using Lighthouse CI to collect performance measurements is a good place to start
with performance monitoring. However, advanced users may want to go a step
further and use Lighthouse CI to fail builds if they don't meet pre-defined
criteria such as passing particular Lighthouse audits or meeting all performance
budgets. This behavior is configured through the
[`assert`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#assert)
property of the `lighthouserc.js` file.

Lighthouse CI supports three levels of assertions:
*   `off`: ignore assertions
*   `warn`: print failures to stderr
*   `error`: print failures to stderr and exit Lighthouse CI with a non-zero
    [exit
    code](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Exit-Status.html#:~:text=A%20non%2Dzero%20exit%20status,N%20as%20the%20exit%20status.)

Below is an example of a `lighthouserc.js` configuration that includes
assertions. It sets assertions for the scores of Lighthouse's performance and
accessibility categories. To try this out, add the assertions shown below to
your `lighthouserc.js` file, then rerun Lighthouse CI.

```js
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      // ...
    },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        'categories:performance': ['warn', {minScore: 1}],
        'categories:accessibility': ['error', {minScore: 1}]
      }
    },
    upload: {
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```

The console output that it generates looks like this:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./lhci-warning.png" alt="Screenshot of a warning message generated by Lighthouse CI" class="w-screenshot">
</figure>

For more information on Lighthouse CI assertions, refer to the
[documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#assert).

## Set up a GitHub Action to run Lighthouse CI {: #github-actions }

{% Aside %} This section assumes that you're familiar with git, GitHub, and
  GitHub Pull Requests. {% endAside %}

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) can be used to run
Lighthouse CI. This will generate a new Lighthouse report every time that a code
change is pushed to any branch of a GitHub repository. Use this in conjunction
with a [status
check](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks)
to display these results on each pull request.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./github-action1.png" alt="Screenshot of a GitHub status check" class="w-screenshot">
</figure>

1.  In the root of your repository, create a directory named
    `.github/workflows`. The
    [workflows](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow#about-workflows)
    for your project will go in this directory. A workflow is a process that
    runs at a predetermined time (for example, when code is pushed) and is
    composed of one or more actions.

    ```shell
    mkdir .github
    mkdir .github/workflows
    ```

2.  In `.github/workflows` create a file named `lighthouse-ci.yaml`. This file
    will hold the configuration for a new workflow. 

    ```shell
    touch lighthouse-ci.yaml
    ```

3.  Add the following text to `lighthouse-ci.yaml`. 

    ```yaml
    name: Build project and run Lighthouse CI
    on: [push]
    jobs:
      lhci:
        name: Lighthouse CI
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v1
          - name: Use Node.js 10.x
            uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
              node-version: 10.x
          - name: npm install
            run: |
              npm install
          - name: run Lighthouse CI
            run: |
              npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.3.x
              lhci autorun --upload.target=temporary-public-storage || echo "LHCI failed!"
    ```

    This configuration sets up a workflow consisting of a single job that will run
    whenever new code is pushed to the repository. This job has four steps:

    *   Check out the repository that Lighthouse CI will be run against
    *   Install and configure Node
    *   Install required npm packages
    *   Run Lighthouse CI and upload the results to temporary public storage.

4.  Commit these changes and push them to GitHub. If you've correctly followed
    the steps above, pushing code to GitHub will trigger running the workflow
    you just added.

5.  To confirm that Lighthouse CI has triggered and to view the report it
    generated, go to the **Actions** tab of your project. You should see the
    **Build project and Run Lighthouse CI** workflow listed under your most
    recent commit.

    <figure class="w-figure">
      <img src="./github-action2.png" alt="Screenshot of the Github 'Settings' tab" class="w-screenshot">
    </figure>

    You can navigate to the Lighthouse report corresponding to a particular commit
    from the **Actions** tab. Click on the commit, click on the **Lighthouse CI**
    workflow step, then expand the results of the **run Lighthouse CI** step.

    <figure class="w-figure">
      <img src="./github-action3.png" alt="Screenshot of the Github 'Settings' tab" class="w-screenshot">
    </figure>

    You've just set up a GitHub Action to run Lighthouse CI. This will be most
    useful when used in conjunction with a GitHub [status
    check](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks).

### Set up a GitHub status check {: #github-status-checks }

A status check, if configured, is a message that appears on every PR and
typically includes information such as the results of a test or the success of a
build.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./github-action1.png" alt="Screenshot of the Github 'Settings' tab" class="w-screenshot">
</figure>

The steps below explain how to set up a status check for Lighthouse CI.

1.  Go to the [Lighthouse CI GitHub App
    page](https://github.com/apps/lighthouse-ci) and click **Configure**.

2.  (Optional) If you're part of multiple organizations on GitHub, choose the
    organization that owns the repository for which you want to use Lighthouse
    CI.

3.  Select **All repositories** if you want to enable Lighthouse CI in all
    repositories or select **Only select repositories** if you only want to use
    it in specific repositories, and then select the repositories. Then click
    **Install & Authorize**.

4.  Copy the token that is displayed. You'll use it in the next step.

5.  To add the token, navigate to the **Settings** page of your GitHub
    repository, click **Secrets**, then click **Add a new secret**. 

    <figure class="w-figure">
      <img src="./github-action4.png" alt="Screenshot of the Github 'Settings' tab" class="w-screenshot">
    </figure>

6.  Set the **Name** field to `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` and set the **Value**
    field to the token that you copied in the last step and then click the **Add
    secret** button.

7.  The status check is ready for use. To test it, [create a new pull
    request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
    or push a commit to an existing pull request.


## Set up the Lighthouse CI Server {: #server-setup }

The Lighthouse CI server provides a dashboard for exploring historical
Lighthouse reporting. It can also act as a private, long-term datastore for
Lighthouse reports.

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./server1.png" alt="Screenshot of the Lighthouse CI Server dashboard" class="w-screenshot">
</figure>

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img src="./server2.png" alt="Screenshot of comparing two Lighthouse reports in Lighthouse CI Server" class="w-screenshot">
</figure>

1. Choose which commits to compare.
2. The amount that the Lighthouse score has changed between the two commits.
3. This section only shows metrics that have changed between the two commits.
4. Regressions are highlighted in pink.
5. Improvements are highlighted in blue.

Lighthouse CI Server is best-suited to users who are comfortable deploying and
managing their own infrastructure.

For information on setting up the Lighthouse CI server, including recipes for
using Heroku and Docker for deployment, refer to these
[instructions](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/server.md).
