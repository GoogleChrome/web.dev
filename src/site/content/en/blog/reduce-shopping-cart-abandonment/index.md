# Guide: Reduce shopping cart abandonment

Shopping carts are the gateway to conversion, but they aren't just for checkout.

Customers use shopping carts for many reasons: as a wishlist, todo list and for
comparisons.
Design shopping cart pages with that in mind. Make them easy to use and fun to
browse.

## Be polite

+   Don't force customers to log in to add items to their shopping cart.
    Only ask for login once they are invested and at a time that is sensible
    and convenient.
+   Put the shopping cart icon at the top right of every page. Use a badge
    to show the number of items in the cart. This is what all the most
    successful e-commerce sites do — you better have a very good reason to do
    something different! Our codelab [TODO: link] shows how to do this.
+   Provide visual feedback in response to actions. For example, make it
    clear to customers when they've successfully added or removed an item from
    the cart.
+   Add save-for-later functionality. This encourages customers to keep
    products in mind for a potential later purchase rather than delete them
    from their carts when they check out.

## Help customers do what they want

+   You may want to provide a 'minicart' overlay, but make sure to
    provide a full shopping cart page as well. A well designed shopping cart
    can be a place where customers want to spend time browsing and comparing
    products.
+   Provide adequate product details to shopping cart listings. At the very
    least, include a product image, price, and details that reflect the
    customer's choices such as size and color.
+   High quality images are crucial: see our guide [TODO: link]. Images in
    shopping cart listings can help customers compare products and avoid
    mistakes such as purchasing identical items. They should accurately reflect
    options and styles.
+   Link from product details to product pages.
+   Allow customers to edit product options, such as quantity, size and color.
+   Add gift wrap and other options for individual purchases.
+   Make it easy to remove items and save-for-later. If you don't do that,
    shoppers may be discouraged from moving to checkout.
+   Highlight incomplete or missed offers on the cart page.

## Clarify costs, prices and quantities

+   Make sure to make the total number of items and the quantity of each
    product clear on the shopping cart page.
+   Show shipping costs. If shipping is free (which is
    [good for conversions](https://www.practicalecommerce.com/The-Many-Benefits-of-Offering-Free-Shipping))
    show that clearly — or explain to the customer what they need to do to
    qualify. Enable customers to calculate shipping without forcing them to go
    to checkout.
+   If you do free returns, make this clear. Whether you do or not, link to
    return details. Likewise for guarantees and security information.
+   Provide a clear summary showing all prices, costs and discounts:
    including taxes, promotions and shipping.
+   Make it simple to enter promotional and voucher codes within the cart.
+   Clearly display payment options to encourage customers to proceed to
    checkout.

## Encourage customers to complete purchases

+   Save cart details, and do this automatically.
+   Make the checkout button obvious. Most sites put it at the bottom right
    below the total cost. Unless you have a good reason not to, stick to this
    de facto standard!
+   Keep call-to-action buttons visible on mobile without scrolling — in
    particular, for add-to-cart, checkout and express checkout.
+   Use the shopping cart as an opportunity to offer deals, for example on
    multibuy items or reduce-price add-ons.
+   Consider asking the customer if they'd like to receive notifications if
    it looks like they forgot to check out.
+   On the cart page, avoid features that may distract shoppers from
    checking out: keep it simple.

style, followed by permission dialog. TODO: code!

## Skip the basket!

+   An express checkout option can encourage conversions, particularly
    for impulse buys and small purchases. For example, clicking 'Buy now' on a
    product listing takes you directly to payment without forcing a trip to the
    shopping cart. Less steps, less clicks — no login required.
