## Responsive Design Today

Today, when using the term: "responsive design", you are most likely thinking
about using media queries to change layout when resizing a design from mobile
size, to tablet size, through to desktop size.

{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/3KENjI9FiNARctTiKDak.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}

But soon, this perception of responsive design may be considered as outdated as
using tables for page layout.

Viewport-based media queries give you some powerful tools, but lack a lot of
finesse. They lack the ability to respond to user needs, and the ability to
inject responsive styles into components themselves.

{% Aside %}
When referring to components for the sake of this article, this
means elements, including elements that are made up of other elements, like a
card or sidebar. Those components make up our web pages.
{% endAside %}

You can use global viewport information to style your components, but they still
don't own their styles, and that doesn't work when our design systems are
component-based and not page-based.

The good news is, the ecosystem is changing, and it's changing pretty rapidly.
CSS is evolving, and a new era of responsive design is right on the horizon.

We see this happen about every 10 years. 10 years ago, around 2010-2012, we saw
a huge change with mobile and responsive design, and the emergence of CSS3.

So it works out that, yet again, the ecosystem is ready for some pretty big
changes to happen to CSS. The engineers at Chrome and across the web platform
are prototyping, speccing, and starting the implementation for the next era of
responsive design.

These updates include user-preference based media features, container queries,
and media queries for new screen types, such as foldable screens.

## Responsive to the user

New user preference media features, give you the ability to style web
experiences that align with the user's own specific preferences and needs. This
means that preference media features allow you to adapt your user experiences to
your user's experiences

These user preference media features include:

- `prefers-reduced-motion`
- `prefers-contrast`
- `prefers-reduced-transparency`
- `prefers-color-scheme`
- `inverted-colors`
- And more

Preference features pick up on the preferences a user has set in their operating
system, and help to build a more robust and personalized web experience,
especially for those with accessibility needs.

alt="Turning on accessibility preferences in an operating system", width="800",
height="428" %}

### `prefers-reduced-motion`

Users who have set operating system preferences for [reduced
motion](https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/), are requesting fewer
animations when using their computer in general. Therefore, it's likely that
they wouldn't appreciate a flashy intro screen, card flip animation, intricate
loader, or other flashy animations while using the web.

With `prefers-reduced-motion` you can design your pages with reduced-motion in
mind, and create a motion-enhanced experience for those who don't have this
preference set.

{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/r4z52PPvElemSUJwUCZp.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}

This card has information on both sides. The baseline reduced-motion experience
is a crossfade to show that information, while the motion-enhanced experience is
a card flip.

Prefers-reduced-motion shouldn't mean "no motion", since motion is so critical
to conveying information online. Instead, provide a solid baseline experience
that guides your users without unnecessary movement, and progressively enhance
that experience for your users without those accessibility needs or preferences.

### `prefers-color-scheme`

Another preference media feature is
[`prefers-color-scheme`](/prefers-color-scheme). This feature helps
you to customize your UI to the theme which your user prefers. In their
operating system, whether it's on desktop or mobile, users can set a preference
for light, dark, or auto themes, which change depending on the time of day.

If you set up your page using [CSS custom
properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/--*), swapping
color values is made straightforward. You can quickly update your color theme
values, such as `backgroundColor` and `textOnPrimary` to dynamically adjust to
the new theme within the media query.

{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/j6Ru11BsBzCmINZDXKql.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}

To make it easier to test some of these preference queries out, you can use
DevTools for emulation instead of opening up your system preferences each time.

{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/ol6pVXJLT44wAkRADAcq.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}


### Designing for dark theme

When designing for a dark theme, it's not just about inverting background and
text colors or [dark scrollbars](/color-scheme/). There are a few
considerations you might not realize. For example,
you might need to desaturate colors on a dark background to reduce visual
vibration.

{% Img src="image/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/tWxjbJ6yYUauQoCsySSX.png",
alt="Dont use vibrant, saturated color with dark themes", width="698",
height="640" %}

Instead of using shadows to create depth and draw an element forward, you may
want to use light in the element's background-color to draw it forward. This is
because shadows won't be as effective on a dark background.

Dark themes not only provide a more customized user experience, but they can
also improve battery life significantly in AMOLED screens. Those are the screens
we're seeing in newer high-end phones, and they're becoming increasingly popular
across mobile devices.

alt="screenshot from the talk that showed this graphic originally", width="720",
height="407" %}

A [2018 Android
study](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18076502/google-dark-mode-android-battery-life)
on dark themes showed a power draw savings of up to 60%, depending on the screen
brightness and overall user interface. The 60% statistic came from comparing the
Youtube play screen with a paused video at 100% screen brightness using dark
theme for the app UI vs a light theme.

You should always provide a dark theme experience for your users whenever
possible

## Responsive to the container

One of the most exciting emerging areas in CSS is container queries, also
frequently called element queries. It's hard to understate what the shift from
page-based responsive design to container-based responsive design will do to
evolve the design ecosystem.

Here's an example of the powerful abilities that container queries provide. You
can manipulate any of the card element's styles, including the link list, font
sizes, and overall layout based on its parent container:

<figure>
{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/fvrxk5kXiif6eFX25BH5.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}
<figcaption><a href="https://codepen.io/una/pen/LYbvKpK">See demo on Codepen</a> (behind a flag in Canary).</figcaption>
</figure>

This example shows two identical components with two different container sizes,
both taking up space in a layout created using CSS Grid. Each component fits its
unique space allotment, and styles itself accordingly.

This amount of flexibility is something that is not possible with media queries
alone.

Container queries provide a much more dynamic approach to responsive design.
This means that if you put this card component in a sidebar or hero section or
within a grid inside of the main body of a page, the component itself owns its
responsive information and sizes according to the container, not the viewport

This requires the `@container` at-rule This works in a similar way to a media
query with `@media`, but instead, `@container` queries the parent container for
information rather than the viewport and user agent.

```css
.card {
  contain: size layout;
}

@container (max-width: 850px) {
  .links {
    display: none;
  }

  .time {
    font-size: 1.25rem;
  }

  /* ... */
}
```

First, set containment on the parent element. And then, write a `@container`
query, to style any of the elements within the container based on its size,
using `min-width` or `max-width`.

The code above uses `max-width`, and sets the links to `display:none`, as well
as decreasing the time font size when the container is less than `850px` wide.
### Container query cards

In this demo plant website, each of the product cards, including the one in the
hero, the sidebar of recently viewed items, and the product grid, are all the
exact same component, with the same markup.

<figure>
{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/D4hBchz6kaPjkgx8BCmU.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}
<figcaption><a href="https://codepen.io/una/pen/mdOgyVL">See demo on Codepen</a> (behind a flag in Canary).</figcaption>
</figure>

There are _no_ media queries used to create this entire layout, just container
queries. This allows for each product card to shift to the proper layout to fill
its space. The grid for example, uses a minmax column layout to let the elements
flow into their space, and re-layout the grid when that space is too compressed
(which means that it hit the minimum size).

```css
.product {
  contain: layout inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 350px) {
  .card-container {
    padding: 0.5rem 0 0;
    display: flex;
  }

  .card-container button {
    /* ... */
  }
}

```

When there is at least `350px` of space in the grid, the card layout goes
horizontal by being set to `display: flex`, which has a default flex-direction
of "row".

With less space, the product cards stack. Each product card styles itself,
something that would be impossible with global styles alone.

### Mixing Container Queries with Media Queries

Container queries have so many use cases—one being a calendar component. You
can use container queries to re-layout the calendar events and other segments
based on the available width of their parent.

<figure>
{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/hjV6i4PEu8wounYhHsHf.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}
<figcaption><a href="https://codepen.io/una/pen/RwodQZw">See demo on Codepen</a> (behind a flag in Canary).</figcaption>
</figure>

This demo container queries to change the layout and style of the calendar's
date and day of the week, as well as adjusting the margins and font size on the
scheduled events to help them better fit the space.

Then, use a media query to shift the entire layout for smaller screen sizes.
This example shows how powerful it is to _combine_ media queries (adjusting the
global, or macro styles) with container queries (adjusting the container's
children, and their micro styles).

So now we can think of Macro and Micro layouts within the same UI component to
allow for some really nice nuanced design decisions.

### Using container queries today

These demos are now available to play with behind a flag in Chrome Canary. Go to
`about://flags` in Canary and turn on the `#enable-container-queries` flag.
This will enable support for `@container`, `inline-size` and `block-size` values
for the `contain` property, and the LayoutNG Grid implementation.

### Scoped styles

To build on container queries, the CSS working group is also actively discussing
[scoped styles](https://css.oddbird.net/scope/) to help with proper namespacing
and collision-avoidance for components.

<figure>
{% Img src="image/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/FCHIEO4IouHOQaOJXrQD.png",
alt="scoped styles diagram", width="759", height="636" %}
<figcaption>Figure originally designed by <a href="https://css.oddbird.net/">Miriam Suzanne</a>.
</figure>

Scoped styles allow for pass-through and component-specific styling to avoid
naming collisions, something that many frameworks and plugins like CSS modules
already enable us to do within frameworks. This spec would now allow us to write
encapsulated styles natively for our components with readable CSS without the
need to adjust the markup.

```css
/* @scope (<root>#) [to (<boundary>#)]? { … } */

@scope (.tabs) to (.panel) {
  :scope { /* targeting the scope root */ }
  .light-theme :scope .tab { /* contextual styles */ }
}
```

Scoping would allow us to create "donut shaped" selectors, where we can specify
where to keep a style encapsulated, and where to break out of that scoped style
to refer back to a more global style.

An example of this would be a tab panel, where we'd want the tabs to get the
scoped style, and the panel within the tabs to get a parent style.

## Responsive to the form factor

The next topic in our conversation about the new era of responsive design is a
shift in form factors, and the growing possibilities of what we'll need to be
designing for as a web community (such as shape-shifting screen or virtual
reality).

<figure>
{% Img src="image/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/OeskptFb2djUWWmX7K9y.svg",
alt="Spanning diagram", width="800", height="488" %}
<figcaption>Diagram from <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/Foldables/explainer.md">Microsoft Edge Explainers</a>.
</figure>

Foldable or flexible screens, and designing for screen spanning is one example
of where we can see a form factor shift today. And screen-spanning is yet
another spec being worked on to cover these new form factors and needs.

An experimental [media
query](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/Foldables/explainer.md)
for screen-spanning could help us here. It currently behaves like this: `@media
(spanning: <type of fold>)`. The demo sets up a grid layout with two columns:
one has a width of --sidebar-width, which is 5rem by default, and the other is
`1fr`. When the layout is viewed on a dual screen that has a single vertical
fold, the value of `--sidebar-width` is updated with the environment value of
the left fold.

```css
:root {
  --sidebar-width: 5rem;
}

@media (spanning: single-fold-vertical) {
  --sidebar-width: env(fold-left);
}

main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: var(--sidebar-width) 1fr;
}
```

This enables a layout where the sidebar, the navigation in this case, fills the
space of one of the folds, where the app UI fills the other. This prevents a
"crease" in the UI.

{% Video src="video/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/Uf3RL7EhVZGK2ECiD0sT.mp4",
autoplay=true, muted=true, playsinline=true, loop=true, controls=true %}

You can test out foldable screens in the Chrome DevTools emulator to help debug
and prototype screen spanning directly in the browser.

## Conclusion

Exploring UI design beyond a flat screen is yet another reason why container
queries and scoped styles are so important. They give you the opportunity to
silo component styles from page layout and global styles, and user styles,
enabling more resilient responsive design. This means you can now design macro
layouts using page-based media queries, including screen-spanning nuances. At
the same time using micro layouts with container queries on the components, and
add user-preference based media queries to customize user experiences based on
their unique preferences and need.

{% Img src="image/HodOHWjMnbNw56hvNASHWSgZyAf2/uAJDDUDLcAsLzBf0a27b.png", alt="A
circle of the new responsive", width="800", height="442" %}

_This_ is the new responsive.

It's combining macro layout with micro layout, and on top of all of that, it's
taking user customization and form factor into account.

Any of these changes alone would constitute a considerable shift in how we
design for the web. But combined, they signify a really big shift in how we even
conceptualize responsive design. It's time to think about responsive design
beyond viewport size, and start considering all of these new axes for better
component-based and customized experiences.

The next era of responsive design is here, and you can already start to
explore it yourself.

### web.dev/learnCSS

And for now, if you want to level up your CSS game, and maybe revisit some
basics, my team is launching a brand new, totally free CSS course and reference
on web.dev. You can access it via [web.dev/learnCSS](/learn/css).

I hope you enjoyed this overview on the next era of responsive design, and some
of the primitives that will come along with it, and I also hope you're as
excited as I am about what this means for the future of web design.

It opens up a huge opportunity to us as a UI community to embrace
component-based styles, new form factors, and create user-responsive
experiences.
