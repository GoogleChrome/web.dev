Entering shipping address and contact information through a web form can be a
cumbersome experience for customers. It can cause errors and lower conversion
rate.

That's why the Payment Request API supports a feature to request shipping
address and contact information. This provides multiple benefits:

* Users can pick the right address with just a few taps.    
* The address is always returned in [the standardized
  format](https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/#paymentaddress-interface).    
* Submitting an incorrect address is less likely.

This functionality can be deferred to a payment app to offer a unified payment
experience and it's called *delegation*.

Whenever possible, Chrome delegates the collection of a customer's shipping
address and contact information to the invoked Android payment app. The
delegation reduces the friction during checkout because the user's installed
payment apps usually have more accurate information about their shipping address
and contact details.

The merchant website can dynamically update the shipping options and total price
depending on the customer's choice of the shipping address and the shipping
option.

To add delegation support to an already existing Android payment app,
implement the following steps:

1.  Declare supported delegations.
2.  Parse `PAY` intent extras for required payment options.
3.  Provide required information in payment response.
4.  [Optional] Support dynamic flow:
    1.  Notify the merchant about changes in the user selected payment method,
        shipping address, or shipping option.
    2.  Receive updated payment details from the merchant (for example, the
        adjusted total amount based on the selected shipping option's cost).

## Declare supported delegations

The browser needs to know the list of additional information that your payment
app can provide so it can delegate the collection of that information to your
app. Declare the supported delegations as a `<meta-data>` in your app's
[AndroidManifest.xml](/android-payment-apps-developers-guide/#androidmanifest.xml-2).

```xml
<activity
  android:name=".PaymentActivity"
  â€¦
  <meta-data
    android:name="org.chromium.payment_supported_delegations"
    android:resource="@array/supported_delegations" />
</activity>
```

`<resource>` must be a list of strings chosen from the following valid values: 

```json
[ "payerName", "payerEmail", "payerPhone", "shippingAddress" ]
```

The following example can only provide a shipping address and the payer's email
address.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
  <string-array name="supported_delegations">
    <item>payerEmail</item>
    <item>shippingAddress</item>
  </string-array>
</resources>
```

## Parse `PAY` intent extras for required payment options

The merchant can specify additional required information using the
[`paymentOptions`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#paymentoptions-dictionary)
dictionary. Chrome will provide the list of required options that your app can
provide by passing the following parameters to the `PAY` activity as [Intent
extras](/android-payment-apps-developers-guide/#parameters-2).

### `paymentOptions`

`paymentOptions` is the subset of merchant specified payment options for which
your app has declared delegation support.

```kotlin
val paymentOptions: Bundle? = extras.getBundle("paymentOptions")
val requestPayerName: Boolean? = paymentOptions?.getBoolean("requestPayerName")
val requestPayerPhone: Boolean? = paymentOptions?.getBoolean("requestPayerPhone")
val requestPayerEmail: Boolean? = paymentOptions?.getBoolean("requestPayerEmail")
val requestShipping: Boolean? = paymentOptions?.getBoolean("requestShipping")
val shippingType: String? = paymentOptions?.getString("shippingType")
```

It can include the following parameters:

* `requestPayerName` - The boolean indicating whether or not the payer's name
  is required.
* `requestPayerPhone` - The boolean indicating whether or not the payer's phone
  is required.
* `requestPayerEmail` - The boolean indicating whether or not the payer's email
  is required.
* `requestShipping` - The boolean indicating whether or not shipping information
  is required.
* `shippingType` - The string showing the type of shipping. Shipping type can be
  `"shipping"`, `"delivery"`, or `"pickup"`. Your app can use this hint in its
  UI when asking for the user's address or choice of shipping options.

### `shippingOptions` {: #shipping-options }

`shippingOptions` is the parcelable array of merchant specified shipping
options. This parameter will only exist when `paymentOptions.requestShipping ==
true`.

```kotlin
val shippingOptions: List<ShippingOption>? =
    extras.getParcelableArray("shippingOptions")?.mapNotNull {
        p -> from(p as Bundle)
    }
```

Each shipping option is a `Bundle` with the following keys.

* `id` - The shipping option identifier.
* `label` - The shipping option label shown to the user.
* `amount` - The shipping cost bundle containing `currency` and `value` keys with
  string values.
    * `currency` shows the currency of the shipping cost, as an
      [ISO4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) well-formed
      3-letter alphabet code
    * `value` shows the value of the shipping cost, as a [valid decimal monetary
      value](https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/#dfn-valid-decimal-monetary-value)
* `selected` - Whether or not the shipping option should be selected when the
  payment app displays the shipping options.

All keys other than the `selected` have string values. `selected` has a boolean
value.

```kotlin
val id: String = bundle.getString("id")
val label: String = bundle.getString("label")
val amount: Bundle = bundle.getBundle("amount")
val selected: Boolean = bundle.getBoolean("selected", false)
```

## Provide required information in a payment response

Your app should include the required additional information in its response to
the `PAY`  activity.

To do so the following parameters must be specified as Intent extras:

* `payerName` - The payer's full name. This should be a non-empty string when
  `paymentOptions.requestPayerName` is true.
* `payerPhone` - The payer's phone number. This should be a non-empty string when
  `paymentOptions.requestPayerPhone` is true.
* `payerEmail` - The payer's email address. This should be a non-empty string
  when `paymentOptions.requestPayerEmail` is true.
* `shippingAddress` - The user-provided shipping address. This should be a
  non-empty bundle when `paymentOptions.requestShipping` is true. The bundle
  should have the following keys which represent different parts in a [physical
  address](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#physical-addresses).
    * `city`
    * `countryCode`
    * `dependentLocality`
    * `organization`
    * `phone`
    * `postalCode`
    * `recipient`
    * `region`
    * `sortingCode`
    * `addressLine`  
  All keys other than the `addressLine` have string values. The `addressLine`
  is an array of strings.
* `shippingOptionId` - The identifier of the user-selected shipping option. This
  should be a non-empty string when `paymentOptions.requestShipping` is true.

###  Payment response validation

If the activity result of a payment response received from the invoked payment
app is set to `RESULT_OK`, then Chrome will check for required additional
information in its extras. If the validation fails Chrome will return a rejected
promise from `request.show()` with one of the following developer-facing error
messages:

```json
'Payment app returned invalid response. Missing field "payerEmail".'
'Payment app returned invalid response. Missing field "payerName".'
'Payment app returned invalid response. Missing field "payerPhone".'
'Payment app returned invalid shipping address in response.'
'... is not a valid CLDR country code, should be 2 upper case letters [A-Z]'
'Payment app returned invalid response. Missing field "shipping option".'
```

Below is an example of a valid response:

```kotlin
fun Intent.populateRequestedPaymentOptions() {
    if (requestPayerName) {
        putExtra("payerName", "John Smith")
    }
    if (requestPayerPhone) {
        putExtra("payerPhone", "4169158200")
    }
    if (requestPayerEmail) {
        putExtra("payerEmail", "john.smith@gmail.com")
    }
    if(requestShipping) {
        val address: Bundle = Bundle()
        address.putString("countryCode", "CA")
        val addressLines: Array<String> =
                arrayOf<String>("111 Richmond st. West")
        address.putStringArray("addressLines", addressLines)
        address.putString("region", "Ontario")
        address.putString("city", "Toronto")
        address.putString("postalCode", "M5H2G4")
        address.putString("recipient", "John Smith")
        address.putString("phone", "4169158200")
        putExtra("shippingAddress", address)
        putExtra("shippingOptionId", "standard")
    }
}
```

## Optional: Support dynamic flow

Sometimes the total cost of a transaction increases, such as when the user
chooses the express shipping option, or when the list of available shipping
options or their prices changes when the user chooses an international shipping
address. When your app provides the user-selected shipping address or option, it
should be able to notify the merchant about any shipping address or option
changes and show the user the updated payment details (provided by the
merchant).

### AIDL

To notify the merchant about new changes use the `PaymentDetailsUpdateService`
service declared in Chrome's AndroidManifest.xml. To use this service create two
AIDL files with the following content:

{% Label %}app/src/main/aidl/org/chromium/components/payments/IPaymentDetailsUpdateService{% endLabel %}

```kotlin
package org.chromium.components.payments;
import android.os.Bundle;

interface IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback {
    oneway void updateWith(in Bundle updatedPaymentDetails);

    oneway void paymentDetailsNotUpdated();
}
```

{% Label %}app/src/main/aidl/org/chromium/components/payments/IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback{% endLabel %}

```kotlin
package org.chromium.components.payments;
import android.os.Bundle;
import org.chromium.components.payments.IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback;

interface IPaymentDetailsUpdateService {
    oneway void changePaymentMethod(in Bundle paymentHandlerMethodData,
            IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback callback);

    oneway void changeShippingOption(in String shippingOptionId,
            IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback callback);

    oneway void changeShippingAddress(in Bundle shippingAddress,
            IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback callback);
}
```

### Notify the merchant about changes in the user selected payment method, shipping address, or shipping option

```kotlin
private fun bind() {
    val intent = Intent()
    intent.setClassName(
        callingPackageName,
        "org.chromium.components.payments.PaymentDetailsUpdateService")
    intent.action = IPaymentDetailsUpdateService::class.java.name
    isBound = bindService(intent, connection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE)
}

private val connection = object : ServiceConnection {
    override fun onServiceConnected(className: ComponentName, service: IBinder) {
        val service = IPaymentDetailsUpdateService.Stub.asInterface(service)
        try {
            if (isOptionChange) {
                service?.changeShippingOption(selectedOptionId, callback)
            } else (isAddressChange) {
                service?.changeShippingAddress(selectedAddress, callback)
            } else {
                service?.changePaymentMethod(methodData, callback)
            }
        } catch (e: RemoteException) {
            // Handle the remote exception
        }
    }
}
```
The `callingPackageName` used for the service's start intent can have one of the
following values depending on the browser that has initiated the payment
request.

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Chrome Channel</th>
        <th>Package Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Stable</td>
        <td>
          <code>"com.android.chrome"</code>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Beta</td>
        <td>
          <code>"com.chrome.beta"</code>

      </tr>

        <td>

        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Canary</td>
        <td>
          <code>"com.chrome.canary"</code>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Chromium</td>
        <td>
          <code>"org.chromium.chrome"</code>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

#### `changePaymentMethod`

Notifies the merchant about changes in the user-selected payment method. The
`paymentHandlerMethodData` bundle contains `methodName` and optional `details`
keys both with string values. Chrome will check for a non-empty bundle with a
non-empty `methodName` and send an `updatePaymentDetails` with one of the
following error messages via `callback.updateWith` if the validation fails.

```json
'Method data required.'
'Method name required.'
```

#### `changeShippingOption`

Notifies the merchant about changes in the user-selected shipping option.
`shippingOptionId` should be the identifier of one of the merchant-specified
shipping options. Chrome will check for a non-empty `shippingOptionId` and send
an `updatePaymentDetails` with the following error message via
`callback.updateWith` if the validation fails.

```json
'Shipping option identifier required.'
```

#### `changeShippingAddress`

Notifies the merchant about changes in the user-provided shipping address. Chrome
will check for a non-empty `shippingAddress` bundle with a valid `countryCode`
and send an `updatePaymentDetails` with the following error message via
`callback.updateWith` if the validation fails.

```json
'Payment app returned invalid shipping address in response.'
```

#### Invalid state error message

If Chrome encounters an invalid state upon receiving any of the change requests
it will call `callback.updateWith` with a redacted `updatePaymentDetails`
bundle. The bundle will only contain the `error` key with `"Invalid state"`.
Examples of an invalid state are:

* When Chrome is still waiting for the merchant's response to a previous change
  (such as an ongoing change event).
* The payment-app-provided shipping option identifier does not belong to any of
  the merchant-specified shipping options.

### Receive updated payment details from the merchant

```kotlin
private fun unbind() {
    if (isBound) {
        unbindService(connection)
        isBound = false
    }
}

private val callback: IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback =
    object : IPaymentDetailsUpdateServiceCallback.Stub() {
        override fun paymentDetailsNotUpdated() {
            // Payment request details have not changed.
            unbind()
        }

        override fun updateWith(updatedPaymentDetails: Bundle) {
            newPaymentDetails = updatedPaymentDetails
            unbind()
        }
    }
```

`updatePaymentDetails` is the bundle equivalent to the
[`PaymentRequestDetailsUpdate`](https://w3c.github.io/payment-handler/#the-paymentrequestdetailsupdate)
[WebIDL](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL-1/) dictionary (after redacting the
`modifiers` field) and contains the following optional keys:

* `total` - A bundle containing `currency`  and `value` keys, both keys have
  string values
* `shippingOptions` - The parcelable array of [shipping
  options](#shipping-options)
* `error` - A string containing a generic error message (e.g. when
  `changeShippingOption` does not provide a valid shipping option identifier)
* `stringifiedPaymentMethodErrors` - A JSON string representing validation
  errors for the payment method
* `addressErrors` - A bundle with optional keys identical to [shipping
  address](#provide-required-information-in-a-payment-response) and string
  values. Each key represents a validation error related to its corresponding
  part of the shipping address.

An absent key means its value has not changed.
