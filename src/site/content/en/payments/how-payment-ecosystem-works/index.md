Let's see how the payment ecosystem works with Web Payments.

## The anatomy of Web Payments

_Web Payments_ comprises multiple web standards:

*   **Payment Request API:** The [Payment Request
    API](/how-payment-request-api-works/) enables fast and easy checkouts
    through a native browser UI. It provides a consistent checkout flow while
    reducing the need for users to enter their shipping and payment information
    on every checkout.
*   **Payment Handler API:** The [Payment Handler
    API](/web-based-payment-apps-overview/) opens up the ecosystem to
    payment providers by allowing their web-based payment applications to act as
    payment methods on merchant websites through the standard Payment Request
    API.
*   **Payment Method Identifiers:** The [Payment Method
    Identifiers](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-1:-provide-the-payment-method-identifier)
    defines how strings (`https://google.com/pay`,
    `https://apple.com/apple-pay`, and so on) can be used to identify a payment
    method. Along with standardized payment method identifiers, it allows anyone
    to define their own payment method with URL-based payment method
    identifiers.
*   **Payment Method Manifest:** The [Payment Method
    Manifest](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-2:-serve-the-payment-method-manifest)
    defines the machine-readable manifest file, known as a payment method
    manifest, describing how a payment method participates in the payment
    ecosystem, and how such files are to be used.

## How the payment request process works

There are typically four participants in an online transaction.

1.  The Customer visits a merchant's website, adds items to a shopping cart, and
    starts the checkout flow.
1.  The Merchant needs the customer's payment credentials to process the
    transaction. They present a payment request UI to the customer using [**the
    Payment Request API**](/how-payment-request-api-works). The UI lists various
    methods of payment specified by [**the Payment Method
    Identifiers**](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-1:-provide-the-payment-method-identifier).
    The payment methods can include credit card numbers saved to the browser, or
    payment handlers such as Google Pay, Samsung Pay, and similar. The Merchant can
    optionally request the customer's shipping address and contact information.
1.  If the customer chooses a payment method like Google Pay, Chrome launches
    either a platform-native payment app or a web-based payment app. This step
    is completely up to the payment handler's implementation, based on **the
    Payment Method Manifest**. After the customer authorizes the payment, the
    payment handler returns a response to the Payment Request API, which relays
    it to the merchant site. (If the payment is push type such as bank
    transfers, cryptocurrencies, the payment is already processed when the
    merchant receives the response.)
1.  The merchant site sends a payment credential to a PSP to process the payment
    and initiate funds transfer. Usually, verifying the payment on the server
    side is also required.
1.  The PSP processes the payment, securely requesting a funds transfer from the
    customer's bank or credit card issuer to the merchant, and then returns a
    success or failure result to the merchant website.
1.  The merchant website notifies the customer of the success or failure of the
    transaction and displays the next step, for example, shipping the purchased item.

## Caveat: PSP Reliance

If you are a merchant and want to accept credit card payments, PSPs are an
important link in the payment processing chain. Implementing the Payment Request
API does not remove the need for a PSP.

Merchants usually rely on a third-party PSP to perform payment processing for
convenience and expense reasons. This is primarily because most PSPs maintain
compliance with [PCI
DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard),
an information security standard that regulates the safety of cardholder data.

Because achieving and maintaining strict PCI DSS compliance can be expensive and
difficult, most merchants find that relying on a compliant PSP avoids going
through the certification process themselves. Some large and financially robust
companies, however, obtain their own PCI DSS certification specifically to avoid
such third-party reliance.

It's especially important when you are handling a primary account number (PAN)
as a payment credential, that is the number embossed on the card. Handling one
with JavaScript requires [PCI SAQ
A-EP](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3_2-SAQ-A_EP.pdf)
compliance.

Thus, delegating payment processing to a PCI DSS-compliant PSP both simplifies
the merchant site's requirements and ensures payment information integrity for
the customer.
