{% Aside 'warning' %}

Shipping and address support in [the Payment Request API is removed from the
specification](https://github.com/w3c/payment-request/pull/955) and is no longer
functional.

{% endAside %}

Web Payments APIs are dedicated payment features built into the browser
for the first time. With Web Payments, merchant integration with payment apps
becomes simpler while the customer experience gets streamlined and more secure.

To learn more about the benefits of using Web Payments check out [Empowering
payment apps with Web Payments](/empowering-payment-apps-with-web-payments).

This article walks you through a payment transaction on a merchant website and
helps you understand how payment app integration works.

The process involves 6 steps:

1. The merchant initiates a payment transaction.
2. The merchant shows a payment button.
3. The customer presses the payment button.

4. The browser launches the payment app.

5. If the customer changes payment method, the merchant updates the transaction
   details reflecting the change.

6. After the customer confirms the purchase, the merchant validates the payment
   and completes the transaction.

## Step 1: The merchant initiates a payment transaction

When a customer decides to make a purchase, the merchant initiates the payment
transaction by constructing a
[`PaymentRequest`](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/payments/basics/how-payment-request-api-works)
object. This object includes important information about the transaction:

* Acceptable payment methods and their data to process the transaction.
* Details, such as the total price (required) and information about the items.

```js
const request = new PaymentRequest([{
  supportedMethods: 'https://bobpay.xyz/pay',
  data: {
    transactionId: '****'
  }
}], {
  displayItems: [{
    label: 'Anvil L/S Crew Neck - Grey M x1',
    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '22.15' }
  }],
  total: {
    label: 'Total due',
    amount: { currency: 'USD', value : '22.15' }
  }
});
```

{% Details %}

{% DetailsSummary %}
Including a transaction ID
{% endDetailsSummary %}

Some payment handlers may require the merchant to provide the transaction ID
which they have issued in advance as part of the transaction information. A
typical integration includes communication between the merchant's and the
payment handler's server to reserve the total price. This prevents malicious
customers from manipulating the price and cheating the merchant with a
validation at the end of the transaction.

The merchant can pass a transaction ID as part of the
[`PaymentMethodData`](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentmethoddata)
object's `data` property.
{% endDetails %}

Provided the transaction information, the browser goes through a discovery
process of payment apps specified in the `PaymentRequest` based on the payment
method identifiers. This way, the browser can determine the payment app to
launch as soon as the merchant is ready to proceed with the transaction.

To learn how the discovery process works in detail check out [Setting up a
payment
method](/setting-up-a-payment-method#how-a-browser-discovers-a-payment-app).

## Step 2: The merchant shows a payment button

Merchants can support many payment methods, but should only present the payment
buttons for those that a customer can actually use. Showing a payment button
that is unusable is poor user experience. If a merchant can predict that a
payment method specified in the `PaymentRequest` object won't work for the
customer, they can provide a fallback solution or not show that button at all.

Using a `PaymentRequest` instance, a merchant can query whether a customer has
the payment app available.

### Does the customer have the payment app available?

The
[`canMakePayment()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PaymentRequest/canMakePayment)
method of `PaymentRequest` returns `true` if a payment app is available on the
customer's device. "Available" means that a payment app that supports the
payment method is discovered, and that the platform-specific payment app is installed, or
the web-based payment app is [ready to be
registered](/setting-up-a-payment-method#jit-register).

```js
const canMakePayment = await request.canMakePayment();
if (!canMakePayment) {
  // Fallback to other means of payment or hide the button.
}
```

## Step 3: The customer presses the payment button {: #show }

When the customer presses the payment button, the merchant calls the `show()`
method of the `PaymentRequest` instance which immediately triggers the launch of
the payment UI.

In case the final total price is set dynamically (for example, retrieved from a
server), the merchant can defer the launch of the payment UI until the total is
known.

### Deferring the launch of the payment UI

Check out a demo of [deferring the payment
UI](https://rsolomakhin.github.io/pr/wait/) until the final total price is
determined.

To defer the payment UI, the merchant passes a promise to the `show()` method.
The browser will show a loading indicator until the promise resolves and the
transaction is ready to begin.

```js
const getTotalAmount = async () => {
  // Fetch the total amount from the server, etc.
};

try {
  const result = await request.show(getTotalAmount());
  // Process the resultâ€¦
} catch(e) {
  handleError(e);
}
```

If there is no promise specified as an argument for `show()`, the browser will
launch the payment UI immediately.

{% Aside %}
If the payment handler is designed to return a transaction ID upon setting the
total price, the ID can be passed as part of the promise result.
{% endAside %}

## Step 4: The browser launches the payment app {: #launch }

The browser can launch a platform-specific or a web-based payment app. (You can learn more
about [how Chrome determines which payment app to
launch](/setting-up-a-payment-method#how-chrome-determines-which-payment-app-to-launch).)

How the payment app is built is up to the developer for the most part, but the
events emitted from and to the merchant, as well as the structure of the data
passed along with those events, are standardized.

When the payment app is launched, it receives [the transaction
information](https://w3c.github.io/payment-handler/#the-paymentrequestevent)
passed to the `PaymentRequest` object in Step 1, which includes the following:

* Payment method data
* Total price

The payment app uses the transaction information to label its UI.

## Step 5: How a merchant can update the transaction details depending on customer's actions

Customers have an option to change the transaction details such as payment
method in the payment app. While the customer makes changes, the merchant
receives the change events and updates the transaction details.

There are four types of events a merchant can receive:

* Payment method change event
* Merchant validation event

### Payment method change event

A payment app can support multiple payment methods and a merchant may offer a
special discount depending on the customer's selection. To cover this use case,
the payment method change event can inform the merchant of the new payment
method so that they can update the total price with the discount and return it
back to the payment app.

```js
request.addEventListener('paymentmethodchange', e => {
  e.updateWith({
    // Add discount etc.
  });
});
```

### Merchant validation event

For additional security, a payment app can perform a merchant validation before
proceeding to the payment flow. The design of the validation mechanism is up to
the payment app, but the merchant validation event serves to inform the merchant
of the URL they can use to validate themselves.

```js
request.addEventListener('merchantvalidation', e => {
  e.updateWith({
    // Use `e.validateURL` to validate
  });
});
```

{% Aside %}
The support for the merchant validation event is limited to Apple Safari. Chromium-based
browsers have not implemented this event as of May 2020.
{% endAside %}

## Step 6: The merchant validates the payment and completes the transaction

When the customer successfully authorizes the payment, the `show()` method
returns a promise that resolves to a
[`PaymentResponse`](https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/#paymentresponse-interface).
The `PaymentResponse` object includes the following information:

* Payment result details

At this point, the browser UI may still show a loading indicator meaning that
the transaction is not completed yet.

If the payment app is terminated because of a payment failure or error, the
promise returned from `show()` rejects, and the browser terminates the payment
transaction.

### Processing and validating the payment

The `details` in `PaymentResponse` is the payment credential object returned
from the payment app. The merchant can use the credential to process or validate
the payment. How this critical process works is up to the payment handler.

### Completing or retrying the transaction

After the merchant determines whether the transaction has succeded or failed,
they can either:

* Call the `.complete()` method to complete the transaction and dismiss the
  loading indicator.
* Let the customer retry by calling the `retry()` method.

```js
async function doPaymentRequest() {
  try {
    const request = new PaymentRequest(methodData, details);
    const response = await request.show();
    await validateResponse(response);
  } catch (err) {
    // AbortError, SecurityError
    console.error(err);
  }
}

async function validateResponse(response) {
  try {
    const errors = await checkAllValuesAreGood(response);
    if (errors.length) {
      await response.retry(errors);
      return validateResponse(response);
    }
    await response.complete("success");
  } catch (err) {
    // Something went wrongâ€¦
    await response.complete("fail");
  }
}
// Must be called as a result of a click
// or some explicit user action.
doPaymentRequest();
```
