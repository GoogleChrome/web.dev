Web-based payment apps are [Progressive Web Apps
(PWA)](/progressive-web-apps/) and run on top of [service
workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). The
service worker in a payment app plays an important role as it captures payment
requests from a merchant, launches the payment app, and mediates the
communication with the merchant.

To configure a web-based payment app, you need to register available payment
methods, delegation options, and a service worker. You can configure your
web-based payment app declaratively with a web app manifest or imperatively with
JavaScript.

{% include 'content/payments/browser-compatibility.njk' %}

## Configuring a payment app with a web app manifest

To configure your web-based payment app declaratively, [serve a web app
manifest](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-3:-serve-a-web-app-manifest).

The following properties in the web app manifest are relevant for web-based payment apps:
* `name`
* `icons`
* `serviceworker`
    * `src`
    * `scope`
    * `use_cache`
* `payment`
    * `supported_delegations`

Check out [Setting up a payment
method](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-3:-serve-a-web-app-manifest)
to make sure your payment method manifest points to your web app manifest
properly.

### Registering a service worker just-in-time (JIT)

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
Service workers are usually registered using JavaScript, but they can also be
automatically registered by the browser when the user chooses to pay with a
web-based payment app on a merchant website. This is called *just-in-time (JIT)
registration*.
{% endAside %}

The JIT registration requires only serving [the web app
manifest](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-3:-serve-a-web-app-manifest)
and no additional coding. If you've already configured your web app manifest and
are serving it properly, you should be all set. The browser will handle the
rest.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
While a single payment method identifier can support multiple payment apps,
JIT registration happens only when the payment method manifest points to a
single payment app.
{% endAside %}

## Configure a payment app with JavaScript

Configuring a web-based payment app using JavaScript allows you to register
multiple payment methods and manually unregister service workers.

### Manually register a service worker

A service worker is a JavaScript file you can register using
[`navigator.serviceWorker.register()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register).
If you have a service worker file named `service-worker.js`, you can register it
to the visitor's browser by running the following code:

<!--
  {% Glitch {
    id: 'paymenthandler-demo',
    path: 'public/index.js:32:1',
    height: 480
  } %}
  -->

{% Label %}[payment handler] payment app's landing page{% endLabel %}

```js
// Feature detection
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Register a service worker
  navigator.serviceWorker.register(
    // A service worker JS file is separate
    'service-worker.js'
  );
  // PaymentManager requires the service worker to be active.
  // One simple method to activate a service worker is through
  // a `ready` promise.
  const registration = await navigator.serviceWorker.ready;
…
```

{% include 'content/reliable/workbox.njk' %}

{% Aside %}
If you are new to the service worker, learn more at [Service Workers: an
Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers).
{% endAside %}

### Set a payment instrument

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
Payment apps can support multiple ways for making a payment. For example, a
customer can add multiple credit cards or e-wallets to a payment app. Each of
them is a payment instrument.
{% endAside %}

Once the service worker is registered, [a service worker registration
object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration) is
returned. Call
[`registration.paymentManager.instrument.set()`](https://w3c.github.io/payment-handler/#paymentinstruments-interface)
to set a payment instrument. It accepts two arguments, a string that represents
the instrument key and a [`PaymentInstrument`
object](https://w3c.github.io/payment-handler/#dom-paymentinstrument) that
contains details about the instrument.

{% Label %}[payment handler] payment app's landing pages{% endLabel %}

```js
…
  // Feature detection
  if (!registration.paymentManager) return;


  await registration.paymentManager.instruments.set(
    // Payment instrument key
    'bobpay_card_1',
    // Payment instrument details
    {
      // This parameter will be ignored in Chrome
      name: 'Payment Handler Example',
      // This parameter will be used to match against
      // the PaymentRequest.
      method: 'https://bobpay.xyz/pay'
    }
  );
```

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

{% Aside %}
Chrome ignores the `name` and `icons` properties. It respects the [web app
manifest](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-3:-serve-a-web-app-manifest)'s
respective properties instead, but other browsers may behave differently.
{% endAside %}

### Enable delegations

Entering shipping address and contact information through a web form can be a
cumbersome experience for customers. It can cause errors and lower conversion
rate.

That's why the Payment Request API supports a feature to request shipping
address and contact information. This provides multiple benefits:

* Users can pick the right address with just a few taps.
* The address is always returned in [the standardized
  format](https://w3c.github.io/payment-request/#paymentaddress-interface).
* Submitting an incorrect address is less likely.

Payment apps can integrate this functionality to offer a more unified payment
experience. This is called *delegation*.

  </video>
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Web-based payment apps can declare their support for delegation using the web
app manifest's `payment.supported_delegations` field or through JavaScript.

To let the browser know that the payment app accepts a delegation, use
[`PaymentManager.enableDelegations()`](https://w3c.github.io/payment-handler/#enabledelegations-method).

{% Label %}[payment handler] payment app's landing page{% endLabel %}

```js
…
 await registration.paymentManager.enableDelegations([
  'shippingAddress', 'payerName'
]);
…
```

You can declare supported delegation options as an array of strings:

* `shippingAddress`: The payment handler can provide a shipping address.
* `payerName`: The payment handler can provide the payer's name.
* `payerPhone`: The payment handler can provide the payer's phone number.
* `payerEmail`: The payment handler can provide the payer's address.

## Debugging a web-based payment app

When developing a web-based payment app frontend, you'll probably jump between
merchant context and payment app context. The following debugging tips will help
your developing experience on Chrome.

### Developing on a local server

Which server do you use for development? Many developers tend to use localhost
or a company-internal server environment which can be challenging because
powerful features in the browser tend to require a secure environment (HTTPS)
and a valid certificate. The Payment Request API and the Payment Handler API are
no exception and localhosts or company-internal servers usually don't come with
a valid certificate.

The good news is some browsers, including Chrome, exempt certificates for
`http://localhost` by default. Also in Chrome, you can exempt the certificate
requirement by launching a Chrome instance. For example, to exempt the
requirement from `http://*.corp.company.com`, use the following flags:

* [`--ignore-certificate-errors`](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/988b56b519836f3d3d94f145ba3554a0c0a7d0a8)
* [`--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://*.corp.company.com`](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/77a7e1a65d14072149ec4420a0ab523586011d8a)

**macOS**

```shell
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://*.corp.company.com
```

**Windows**

```shell
chrome.exe --ignore-certificate-errors --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://*.corp.company.com
```

Learn more about running Chrome with a runtime flag at [Run Chromium with
flags](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags).

### Port forwarding a local server

You can port forward the local web server to an Android device using Chrome's
DevTools and test how it works from a mobile browser. To learn how to do it,
check out [Access Local
Servers](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/local-server).

### Remote debugging a website on Android Chrome from desktop DevTools

You can also debug Android Chrome on desktop DevTools. To learn how to do it,
check out [Get Started with Remote Debugging Android
Devices](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging).

### Payment Handler event logging

[DevTools can display Payment Handler API
events](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/09/devtools#payments) for
easier local development. Open DevTools on the merchant context and go to the
"Payment Handler" section under the **Application** pane. Check "Show events
from other domains" and click the "Record" button to start capturing events sent
to the service worker that handles payments.
