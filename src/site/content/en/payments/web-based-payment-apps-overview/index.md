[Web Payments](/empowering-payment-apps-with-web-payments/#what-is-web-payments)
brings to the web a browser's built-in interface that allows users to enter
required payment information easier than ever before. The APIs can invoke
web-based payment apps, as well as [native payment
apps](/android-payment-apps-developers-guide/).

## Benefits of web-based payment apps

* Payments are made in modals, in the context of the merchant website, which
  provides better user experience than typical payment app techniques that use
  redirects or pop-ups.
* Web Payments APIs can be integrated into established websites allowing you to
  leverage the existing user base.
* Unlike native apps, web-based payment apps don't need to be installed in
  advance.

## How does a web-based payment app work?

Web-based payment apps are built using the standard web technologies. Every
web-based payment app must include a service worker.

{% Aside %}
A [Service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers)
is an event-driven script that runs in the background even if the registering
website is not open in the browser. Service workers enable websites to work
offline and send push notifications, because they can respond to requests with
a cache that is stored locally in advance.
{% endAside %}

In a web-based payment app, a service worker can act as a mediator for payment
requests by:

* Opening a modal window and displaying the payment app's interface.
* Bridging the communication between the payment app and the merchant.
* Getting an authorization from the customer and passing the payment credential
  to the merchant.

Learn how a payment app works on a merchant in [Life of a payment
transaction](/life-of-a-payment-transaction/).

## How merchants discover your payment app

In order for a merchant to use your payment app, they need to use the [Payment
Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API) and
specify the payment method you support using the [payment method
identifier](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-1:-provide-the-payment-method-identifier).

If you have a payment method identifier that is unique to your payment app, you
can set up your own [payment method
manifest](/setting-up-a-payment-method/#step-2:-serve-the-payment-method-manifest)
and let browsers discover your app.

Learn how it works and how you can set up a new payment method in [Setting up a
payment method](/setting-up-a-payment-method/).

## APIs you can use inside the payment handler window

A "payment handler window" is a window in which payment apps are launched. In
Chrome, since it's a regular Chrome browser window, most web APIs should work as
if used in a top-level document, with only a few exceptions:

* Resizing the viewport is disabled.
* `window.open()` is disabled.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Payment Handler API is only supported in Chrome as of July 2020. However, since
Chromium based browsers already have the implementation, some of them may expose
the API in the future. Also, [Mozilla recently announced it's implementing the
API](https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.platform/c/gBQp1URD1lE/m/Fswh-5-ZBgAJ).
{% endAside %}

### WebAuthn support

[WebAuthn](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/webauthn) is an
authentication mechanism based on the public key cryptography. You can let users
sign-in through a biometric verification. WebAuthn is already supported in the
payment handler window on Chrome, and the standard body is looking into creating
an even-tighter connection between Web Payments and WebAuthn.

### Credential Management API support

[The Credential Management
API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management/)
provides a programmatic interface between the site and the browser for seamless
sign-in across devices. You can let users sign-in to your website automatically
based on the information stored to the browser's password manager. It's planned
to be enabled in Chrome, but still [under
development](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1052383).

### WebOTP support

[The Web OTP API](/web-otp/) helps you programmatically obtain an
OTP from an SMS message and verify a phone number for the user more easily. It's
planned to be enabled in Chrome, but still [under
development](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1051930).

You can check out the list of known issues and features planned to be added to
the payment handler window in the [Chromium bug
tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/u/maxlg@chromium.org/hotlists/Expandable-payment-handler).

## Next steps
To start building a web-based payment app, you have three distinct parts to implement:

* [Registering a web-based payment app](/registering-a-web-based-payment-app)
* [Orchestrating payment transactions with a service worker](/orchestrating-payment-transactions)
* [Handling optional payment information with a service worker](/handling-optional-payment-information)
