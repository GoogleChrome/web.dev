  Modern JavaScript offers size and performance improvements over transpiled ES5,
  and is supported in 95% of web browsers. Enabling Modern JavaScript output brings
  these benefits to your application, but the impact is limited by dependencies that
  are already transpiled to ES5. This guide demonstrates how to publish modern packages
  to npm, and how to install and optimally bundle modern JavaScript packages.
