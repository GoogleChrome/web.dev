  Modern JavaScript offers size and performance improvements over transpiled ES5,
  and is supported in 95% of web browsers. Enabling modern JavaScript output brings
  these benefits to your application, but the impact is limited by dependencies that
  are already transpiled to ES5. This guide demonstrates how to publish modern packages
  to npm, and how to install and optimally bundle modern JavaScript packages.

Over 90% of browsers are capable of running modern JavaScript, but the
prevalence of legacy JavaScript remains one of the biggest contributors to
performance problems on the web today. [EStimator.dev](http://estimator.dev/) is
a simple web-based tool that calculates the size and performance improvement a
site could achieve by delivering modern JavaScript syntax.

The web today is limited by legacy JavaScript, and no single optimization will
improve performance as much as writing, publishing, and shipping your web page
or package using **ES2017** syntax.

## Modern JavaScript

Modern JavaScript is not characterized as code written in a specific ECMAScript
specification version, but rather in syntax that is supported by all modern
browsers. Modern web browsers like Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari make up
more than [90% of the browser market](https://www.caniuse.com/usage-table), and
different browsers that rely on the same underlying rendering engines make up an
additional 5%. This means that 95% of global web traffic comes from browsers
that support the most widely used JavaScript language features from the past 10
years, including:

- Classes (ES2015)
- Arrow functions (ES2015)
- Generators (ES2015)
- Block scoping (ES2015)
- Destructuring (ES2015)
- Rest and spread parameters (ES2015)
- Object shorthand (ES2015)
- Async/await (ES2017)

Features in newer versions of the language specification generally have less
consistent support across modern browsers. For example, many ES2020 and ES2021
features are only supported in 70% of the browser market—still the majority of
browsers, but not enough that it's safe to rely on those features directly. This
means that although "modern" JavaScript is a moving target, ES2017 has the
widest range of browser compatibility
[while including most of the commonly used modern syntax features](https://dev.to/garylchew/bringing-modern-javascript-to-libraries-432c).
In other words, **ES2017 is the closest to modern syntax today**.

## Legacy JavaScript

Legacy JavaScript is code that specifically avoids using all the above language
features. Most developers write their source code using modern syntax, but
compile everything to legacy syntax for increased browser support. Compiling
to legacy syntax does increase browser support, however the effect is often
smaller than we realize. In many cases the support increases from around 95%
to 98% while incurring a significant cost:

- Legacy JavaScript is typically around 20% larger and slower than
  equivalent modern code. Tooling deficiencies and misconfiguration often
  widen this gap even further.

- Installed libraries account for as much as 90% of typical production
  JavaScript code. Library code incurs an even higher legacy JavaScript
  overhead due to polyfill and helper duplication that could be avoided
  by publishing modern code.

## Modern JavaScript on npm

Recently, Node.js has standardized an `"exports"` field to define
[entry points for a package](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_package_entry_points):

```json
{
  "exports": "./index.js"
}
```

Modules referenced by the `"exports"` field imply a Node version of at least
12.8, which supports ES2019. This means that any module referenced using the
`"exports"` field can be _written in modern JavaScript_. Package consumers must
assume modules with an `"exports"` field contain modern code and transpile if
necessary.

### Modern-only

If you want to publish a package with modern code and leave it up to the
consumer to handle transpiling it when they use it as a dependency—use only the
`"exports"` field.

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "exports": "./modern.js"
}
```

{% Aside 'caution' %}
This approach is _not recommended_. In a perfect world, every developer
would have already configured their build system to transpile all dependencies
(`node_modules`) to their required syntax. However, this is not currently the
case, and publishing your package using only modern syntax would prevent its
usage in applications that would be accessed through legacy browsers.
{% endAside %}

### Modern with legacy fallback

Use the `"exports"` field along with `"main"` in order to publish your package
using modern code but also include an ES5 + CommonJS fallback for legacy
browsers.

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "exports": "./modern.js",
  "main": "./legacy.cjs"
}
```

### Modern with legacy fallback and ESM bundler optimizations

In addition to defining a fallback CommonJS entrypoint, the `"module"` field can
be used to point to a similar legacy fallback bundle, but one that uses
JavaScript module syntax (`import` and `export`).

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "exports": "./modern.js",
  "main": "./legacy.cjs",
  "module": "./module.js"
}
```

Many bundlers, such as webpack and Rollup, rely on this field to take advantage
of module features and enable
[tree shaking](/commonjs-larger-bundles/#how-does-commonjs-affect-your-final-bundle-size).
This is still a legacy bundle that does not contain any modern code aside from
`import`/`export` syntax, so use this approach to ship modern code with a
legacy fallback that is still optimized for bundling.

## Modern JavaScript in applications

Third-party dependencies make up the vast majority of typical production
JavaScript code in web applications. While npm dependencies have historically
been published as legacy ES5 syntax, this is no longer a safe assumption and
risks dependency updates breaking browser support in your application.

With an increasing number of npm packages moving to modern JavaScript, it's
important to ensure that the build tooling is set up to handle them. There's a
good chance some of the npm packages you depend on are already using modern
language features. There are a number of options available to use modern code
from npm without breaking your application in older browsers, but the general
idea is to have the build system transpile dependencies to the same syntax
target as your source code.

## webpack

As of webpack 5, it is now possible to configure what syntax webpack will use
when generating code for bundles and modules. This doesn't transpile your
code or dependencies, it only affects the "glue" code generated by webpack.
To specify the browser support target, add a
[browserslist configuration](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#readme)
to your project, or do it directly in your webpack configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: ['web', 'es2017'],
};
```

It is also possible to configure webpack to generate optimized bundles that
omit unnecessary wrapper functions when targeting a modern ES Modules
environment. This also configures webpack to load code-split bundles using
`<script type="module">`.

```js
module.exports = {
  target: ['web', 'es2017'],
  output: {
    module: true,
  },
  experiments: {
    outputModule: true,
  },
};
```

There are a number of webpack plugins available that make it possible to
compile and ship modern JavaScript while still supporting legacy browsers,
such as Optimize Plugin and BabelEsmPlugin.

### Optimize Plugin

[Optimize Plugin](https://github.com/developit/optimize-plugin) is a webpack
plugin that transforms final bundled code from modern to legacy JavaScript
instead of each individual source file. It's a self-contained setup that allows
your webpack configuration to assume everything is modern JavaScript with no
special branching for multiple outputs or syntaxes.

Since Optimize Plugin operates on bundles instead of individual modules, it
processes your application's code and your dependencies equally. This makes it
safe to use modern JavaScript dependencies from npm, because their code will be
bundled and transpiled to the correct syntax. It can also be faster than
traditional solutions involving two compilation steps, while still generating
separate bundles for modern and legacy browsers. The two sets of bundles are
designed to be loaded using the
[module/nomodule pattern](/serve-modern-code-to-modern-browsers/).

```js
// webpack.config.js
const OptimizePlugin = require('optimize-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [new OptimizePlugin()],
};
```

`Optimize Plugin` can be faster and more efficient than custom webpack
configurations, which typically bundle modern and legacy code separately. It
also handles running [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for you, and minifies
bundles using [Terser](https://terser.org/) with separate optimal settings for
the modern and legacy outputs. Finally, polyfills needed by the generated
legacy bundles are extracted into a dedicated script so they are never
duplicated or unnecessarily loaded in newer browsers.

### BabelEsmPlugin

[BabelEsmPlugin](https://github.com/prateekbh/babel-esm-plugin) is a webpack
plugin that works along with
[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env)
to generate modern versions of existing bundles to ship less transpiled code to
modern browsers. It is the most popular off-the-shelf solution for
module/nomodule, used by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and
[Preact CLI](https://preactjs.com/cli/).

```js
// webpack.config.js
const BabelEsmPlugin = require('babel-esm-plugin');

module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      // your existing babel-loader configuration:
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [new BabelEsmPlugin()],
};
```

`BabelEsmPlugin` supports a wide array of webpack configurations, because it
runs two largely separate builds of your application. Compiling twice can take a
little bit of extra time for large applications, however this technique allows
`BabelEsmPlugin` to integrate seamlessly into existing webpack configurations
and makes it one of the most convenient options available.

### Configure babel-loader to transpile node_modules

If you are using `babel-loader` without one of the previous two plugins,
there's an important step required in order to consume modern JavaScript npm
modules. Defining two separate `babel-loader` configurations makes it possible
to automatically compile modern language features found in `node_modules` to
ES2017, while still transpiling your own first-party code with the Babel
plugins and presets defined in your project's configuration. This doesn't
generate modern and legacy bundles for a module/nomodule setup, but it does
make it possible to install and use npm packages that contain modern JavaScript
without breaking older browsers.

[webpack-plugin-modern-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-plugin-modern-npm)
uses this technique to compile npm dependencies that have an `"exports"` field
in their `package.json`, since these may contain modern syntax:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const ModernNpmPlugin = require('webpack-plugin-modern-npm');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // auto-transpile modern stuff found in node_modules
    new ModernNpmPlugin(),
  ],
};
```

Alternatively, you can implement the technique manually in your webpack
configuration by checking for an `"exports"` field in the `package.json` of
modules as they are resolved. Omitting caching for brevity, a custom
implementation might look like this:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      // Transpile for your own first-party code:
      {
        test: /\.js$/i,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
      // Transpile modern dependencies:
      {
        test: /\.js$/i,
        include(file) {
          let dir = file.match(/^.*[/\\]node_modules[/\\](@.*?[/\\])?.*?[/\\]/);
          try {
            return dir && !!require(dir[0] + 'package.json').exports;
          } catch (e) {}
        },
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            babelrc: false,
            configFile: false,
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

When using this approach, you'll need to ensure modern syntax is supported by
your minifier. Both [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser#minify-options)
and [uglify-es](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/tree/harmony#minify-options)
have an option to specify `{ecma: 2017}` in order to preserve and in some cases
generate ES2017 syntax during compression and formatting.

## Rollup

Rollup has built-in support for generating multiple sets of bundles as part of
a single build, and generates modern code by default. As a result, Rollup can
be configured to generate modern and legacy bundles with the official plugins
you're likely already using.

### @rollup/plugin-babel

If you use Rollup, the
[`getBabelOutputPlugin()` method](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/babel#running-babel-on-the-generated-code)
(provided by Rollup's
[official Babel plugin](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/babel))
transforms the code in generated bundles rather than individual source modules.
Rollup has built-in support for generating multiple sets of bundles as part of
a single build, each with their own plugins. You can use this to produce
different bundles for modern and legacy by passing each through a different
Babel output plugin configuration:

```js
// rollup.config.js
import {getBabelOutputPlugin} from '@rollup/plugin-babel';

export default {
  input: 'src/index.js',
  output: [
    // modern bundles:
    {
      format: 'es',
      plugins: [
        getBabelOutputPlugin({
          presets: [
            [
              '@babel/preset-env',
              {
                targets: {esmodules: true},
                bugfixes: true,
                loose: true,
              },
            ],
          ],
        }),
      ],
    },
    // legacy (ES5) bundles:
    {
      format: 'amd',
      entryFileNames: '[name].legacy.js',
      chunkFileNames: '[name]-[hash].legacy.js',
      plugins: [
        getBabelOutputPlugin({
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
        }),
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

## Additional build tools

Rollup and webpack are highly-configurable, which generally means each project
must update its configuration enable modern JavaScript syntax in dependencies.
There are also higher-level build tools that favor convention and defaults over
configuration, like [Parcel], [Snowpack], [Vite] and [WMR]. Most of these tools
assume npm dependencies may contain modern syntax, and will transpile them to
the appropriate syntax level(s) when building for production.

In addition to dedicated plugins for webpack and Rollup, modern JavaScript
bundles with legacy fallbacks can be added to any project using
[devolution](https://github.com/theKashey/devolution). Devolution is a
standalone tool that transforms the output from a build system to produce legacy
JavaScript variants, allowing bundling and transformations to assume a modern
output target.

## Conclusion

[EStimator.dev](http://estimator.dev/) was built to provide an easy way to
assess how much of an impact it can make to switch to modern-capable JavaScript
code for the majority of your users. Today, ES2017 is the closest to modern
syntax and tools such as npm, Babel, webpack, and Rollup have made it possible
to configure your build system and write your packages using this syntax. This
post covers several approaches, and you should use the easiest option that works
for your use case.
