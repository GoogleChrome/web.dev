This article discusses performance best practices for fonts. There are a variety
of ways in which web fonts impact performance:



*   **Delayed text rendering:** If a web font has not loaded, browsers typically
    delay text rendering. In many situations, this delays [First Contentful
    Paint (FCP)](/fcp). In some situations, this delays [Largest
    Contentful Paint (LCP)](/lcp/).
*   **Layout shifts:** The practice of font swapping has the potential to [cause
    layout
    shifts](/debug-layout-shifts/#identifying-the-cause-of-a-layout-shift).
    These layout shifts occur when a web font and its fallback font take up
    different amounts of space on the page.

This article is broken down into three sections: font loading, font delivery,
and font rendering. Each section explains how that particular aspect of the font
lifecycle works and provides corresponding best practices.

## Font loading

Before diving into best practices for font loading it's important to understand
how [`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face)
works and how this impacts font loading.

The [`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face)
declaration is an essential part of working with any web font. At a minimum, it
declares the name that will be used to refer to the font and indicates the
location of the corresponding font file.


```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Open Sans";
  src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```

A common misconception is that a font is requested when a `@font-face`
declaration is encountered—this is not true. By itself, `@font-face`
declaration does not trigger font download. Rather, a font is downloaded only if
it is referenced by styling that is used on the page. For example, like this:


```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Open Sans";
  src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2");
}

h1 {
  font-family: "Open Sans"
}
```

In other words, in the example above, `Open Sans` would only be downloaded if
the page contained a `<h1>` element.

{% Aside %}
    Other ways of loading a font are the
    [`preload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content)
    resource hint and the [Font Loading
    API](/optimize-webfont-loading/#the-font-loading-api).
{% endAside %}

Thus, when thinking about font optimization, it's important to give stylesheets
just as much consideration as the font files themselves. Changing the contents
or delivery of stylesheets can have a significant impact on when fonts arrive.
Similarly, removing unused CSS and splitting stylesheets can reduce the number
of fonts loaded by a page.



### Best practices

Fonts are typically important resources, as without them the user might be
unable to view page content. Thus, best practices for font loading generally focus
on making sure that fonts get loaded as early as possible. Particular care
should be given to fonts loaded from third-party sites as downloading these font
files requires separate connection setups.

If you're unsure if your page's fonts are being requested in time, check the
**Timing** tab within the **Network** panel in Chrome DevTools for more
information.

%}



#### Inline font declarations

Most sites would strongly benefit from inlining font declarations and other
critical styling in the `<head>` of the main document rather than including them
in an external stylesheet. This allows the browser to discover the font
declarations sooner as the browser doesn't need to wait for the external
stylesheet to download.


```html
<head>
  <style>
    @font-face {
        font-family: "Open Sans";
        src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2");
    }

    body {
        font-family: "Open Sans";

    }
  </style>
</head>

```

{% Aside %}
    Inlining the font files themselves is not recommended. Inlining large
    resources like fonts is likely to delay the delivery of the main document,
    and with it, the discovery of other resources.

{% endAside %}


#### Preconnect to critical third-party origins

If your site loads fonts from a third-party site, it is highly recommended that
you use the
[`preconnect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preconnect)
resource hint to establish early connection(s) with the third-party origin.
Resource hints should be placed in the `<head>` of the document. The resource
hint below sets up a connection for loading the font stylesheet.


```html
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.com">
</head>
```

To preconnect the connection that is used to download the font file,
add a separate `preconnect` resource hint that uses the `crossorigin`
attribute. Unlike stylesheets, font files must be sent over a [CORS
connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#what_requests_use_cors).

```html
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.com" crossorigin>
</head>
```

When using the `preconnect` resource hint, keep in mind that a font provider may
serve stylesheets and fonts from separate origins. For example, this is how the
`preconnect` resource hint would be used for Google Fonts.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
</head>
```


{% Aside %}

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) provides the option to load fonts via
`<link>` tags or an `@import` statement. The `<link>` code snippet includes a
`preconnect` resource hint and therefore will likely result in faster stylesheet
delivery than using `@import` version. These `<link>` tags should be placed as
early in the document as possible.


{% endAside %}


#### Avoid using preload to load fonts

Generally speaking, using the
[`preload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content)
resource hint to load fonts should be avoided. Although `preload` is highly
effective at making fonts discoverable early in the page load process, this
comes at the cost of taking away browser resources from the loading of other
resources.

In most scenarios, inlining font declarations and adjusting stylesheets is
a more effective approach. These adjustments come closer to addressing the root
cause of late-discovered fonts - rather than just providing a workaround.

In addition, using `preload` as a font-loading strategy should also be used
carefully as it bypasses some of the browser's built-in content negotiation
strategies. For example, `preload` ignores `unicode-range` declarations, and if
used prudently, should only be used to load a single font format.



## Font delivery

Faster font delivery yields faster text rendering. In addition, if a font is
delivered early enough, this can help eliminate layout shifts resulting from
font swapping.



### Best practices


#### Using self-hosted fonts

On paper, using a self-hosted font should deliver better performance as
it eliminates a third-party connection setup. However, in practice, the
performance differences between these two options is less clear cut: for
example, the [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/fonts#fig-7)
found that sites using third-party fonts had a faster render than fonts that
used first-party fonts.

If you are considering using self-hosted fonts, confirm that your site is using
a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/content-delivery-networks/)
and [HTTP/2](/content-delivery-networks/#http2-and-http3).
Without use of these technologies, it is much less likely that self-hosted fonts
will deliver better performance. For more information, see [Content Delivery
Networks](/content-delivery-networks/).

{% Aside %}

If you're unsure if using self-hosted fonts will deliver better performance, try
serving a font file from your own servers and compare the transfer time
(including connection setup) with that of a third-party font. If you have slow
servers, don't use a CDN, or don't use HTTP/2 it becomes less likely that the
self-hosted font will be more performant.

{% endAside %}

If you use a self-hosted font, it is recommended that you also apply some of the
font file optimizations that third-party font providers typically provide
automatically—for example, font subsetting and WOFF2 compression. The amount
of effort required to apply these optimizations will depend somewhat on the
languages that your site supports. In particular, be aware that optimizing fonts
for [CJK languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters) can be
particularly challenging.


**Unicode-range and font subsetting:** `@font-face` is often used in
   conjunction with the
   [`unicode-range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range)
   descriptor. `unicode-range` informs the browser which characters a font can
   be used for.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "Open Sans";
    src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2");
    unicode-range: U+0025-00FF;
}
```

A font file will be downloaded if the page contains one or more characters
matching the unicode range. `unicode-range` is commonly used to serve
different font files depending on the language used by page content.

`unicode-range` is often used in conjunction with the technique of
subsetting. A subset font includes a smaller portion of the
[glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph) (that is, characters) that
were contained in the original font file. For example, rather than serve all
characters to all users, a site might generate separate subset fonts for
Latin and Cyrillic characters. The number of glyphs per font varies wildly:
Latin fonts are usually on the magnitude of 100 to 1000 glyphs per font;
[CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters) fonts may have over
10,000 characters. Removing unused glyphs can significantly reduce the
filesize of a font.

Tools for generating font subsets include
[subfont](https://github.com/Munter/subfont) and
[glyphanger](https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger).

For information on how Google Fonts implements font subsetting, see this
[presentation](https://www.unicodeconference.org/presentations-42/S5T3-Sheeter.pdf).
For the Google Fonts API subsets, see this
[repo](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/main/Lib/gftools/encodings).


**WOFF2:** Of the modern font fonts, [WOFF2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/) is
   the newest, has the widest browser support, and offers the best compression.
   Because it uses Brotli, WOFF2 compresses 30% better than WOFF.



#### Use fewer web fonts

The fastest font to deliver is a font that isn't requested in the first place.
System fonts and variable fonts are two ways to potentially reduce the number of
web fonts used on your site.


A **system font** is the default font used by the user
interface of a user's device. System fonts typically vary by operating system
and version. Because the font is already installed, the font does not need to
be downloaded. System fonts can work particularly well for body text.


To use the system font in your CSS, list `system-ui` as the font-family:

```css
font-family: system-ui
```
The idea behind **[variable
 fonts](/variable-fonts/)** is that a single variable font can be
 used as a replacement for multiple font files. Variable fonts work by
 defining a "default" font style and providing
 ["axes"](/variable-fonts/#axes-definitions) for manipulating
 the font. For example, a variable font with a `Weight` axis could be used to
 implement lettering that would previously require separate fonts for light,
 regular, bold, and extra bold.

{% Aside %}

We often refer to "Times New Roman" and "Helvetica" as fonts. However,
technically speaking, these are font _families_. A family is composed of styles,
which are particular variations of the typeface (for example, light, medium,
or bold italic). A font file contains a single style unless it is a variable font.
A typeface is the underlying design, which can be expressed as digital fonts -
and in physical type, like carved woodblocks or metal.

{% endAside %}

Not everyone will benefit from switching to variable fonts. [Variable
fonts](/variable-fonts/) contain many styles, so typically have larger file
sizes than individual non-variable fonts that only contain one style.
Sites that will see the largest improvement from using variable fonts are
those that use (and need to use) a variety of font styles and weights.


## Font rendering

When faced with a web font that has not yet loaded, the browser is faced with a
dilemma: should it hold off on rendering text until the web font has arrived? Or
should it render the text in a fallback font until the web font arrives?

Different browsers handle this scenario differently. By default, Chromium-based
and Firefox browsers will block text rendering for up to 3 seconds if the
associated web font has not loaded; Safari will block text rendering
indefinitely.

This behavior can be configured by using the `font-display` attribute. This
choice can have significant implications: `font-display` has the potential to
impact LCP, FCP, and layout stability.



### Best practices


#### Choose an appropriate `font-display` strategy

[`font-display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display)
informs the browser how it should proceed with text rendering when the
associated web font has not loaded. It is defined per font-face.


```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Roboto, Sans-Serif
  src: url(/fonts/roboto.woff) format('woff'),
  font-display: swap;
}
```

There are five possible values for `font-display`:


<div class="w-table-wrapper">
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Value</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Block period</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Swap period</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Auto
   </td>
   <td>Varies by browser
   </td>
   <td>Varies by browser
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Block
   </td>
   <td>3 seconds
   </td>
   <td>Infinite
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Swap
   </td>
   <td>0ms
   </td>
   <td>Infinite
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Fallback
   </td>
   <td>100ms
   </td>
   <td>3 seconds
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Optional
   </td>
   <td>100ms
   </td>
   <td>None
   </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>




*   **Block period**: The block period begins when the browser requests a web
    font. During the block period, if the web font is not available, the font is
    rendered in an _invisible_ fallback font and thus the text will not be
    visible to the user. If the font is not available at the end of the block
    period, it will be rendered in the fallback font.
*   **Swap period**: The swap period comes after the block period. If the web
    font becomes available during the swap period, it will be "swapped" in.



##### Recommendation

`font-display` strategies reflect different viewpoints about the tradeoff
between performance and aesthetics. For most sites, these are the two strategies
that will be most applicable:

*  **If performance is a top priority:** Use `font-display: optional`. This is
   the most "performant" approach: text render is delayed for no longer than
   100ms and there is assurance that there will be no font-swap related layout
   shifts.

*  **If displaying text in a web font is a top priority:** Use `font-display:
   swap` but make sure to deliver the font early enough that it does not cause a
   layout shift.

{% Aside %}
    `font-display: auto`, `font-display: block`, `font-display: swap`, and
    `font-display: fallback` all have the potential to cause layout shifts when
    the font is swapped. However, of these approaches, `font-display: swap` will
    delay text render the least. Thus, it is the preferred approach for
    situations where it is important that text ultimately gets rendered as a web
    font.
{% endAside %}

Also keep in mind that these two approaches can be combined: for example, use
`font-display: swap` for branding and other visually distinctive page elements;
use `font-display: optional` for fonts used in body text.


{% Aside %}
    The `font-display` strategies that work well for traditional web fonts don't
    work nearly as well for icon fonts. The fallback font for an icon font
    typically looks significantly different than the icon font and its
    characters may convey a completely different meaning. As a result, icon
    fonts are more likely to cause significant layout shifts. In addition, using
    a fallback font may not be practical. If possible, it's best to replace icon
    fonts with SVG (this is also better for accessibility). Newer versions of
    popular icon fonts typically support SVG. For more information on switching
    to SVG, see [Font
    Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/svg-sprites)
    and [Material Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#svg).
