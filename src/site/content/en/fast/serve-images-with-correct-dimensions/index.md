We've all been there: you forgot to scale down an image before adding it to the
page. The image looks fine, but it is wasting users' data and hurting page
performance.

## Identify incorrectly sized images

Lighthouse makes it easy to identify incorrectly-sized images. Run the
Performance Audit (**Lighthouse > Options > Performance**) and look for the
results of the **Properly size images** audit. The audit lists any images that
need to be resized.

## Determine the correct image size

Image sizing can be deceptively complicated. For this reason, we've provided two
approaches: the "good" and the "better." Both will improve performance, but the
"better" approach may take a bit longer to understand and implement. However, it
will also reward you with bigger performance improvements. The best choice for
you is the one that you feel comfortable implementing.

### A quick note on CSS units

There are two types of CSS units for specifying the size of HTML elements,
including images:

-  Absolute units: Elements styled using absolute units will always be
    displayed at the same size, regardless of device. Examples of valid,
    absolute CSS units: px, cm, mm, in.
-  Relative units: Elements styled using relative units will be displayed at
    varying sizes, depending on the relative length specified. Examples of
    valid, relative CSS units: %, vw (1vw = 1% of the width of the viewport),
    em (1.5 em = 1.5 times font size).

### The "Good" Approach

For images with sizing based on…

- **Relative units**: Resize the image to a size that will work across all devices.

You may find it helpful to check your analytics data (e.g. Google
Analytics) to see which display sizes are commonly used by your users.
Alternatively, [screensiz.es](http://screensiz.es/)
provides information about the displays of many common devices.
- **Absolute units**: Resize the image to match the size that it is displayed at.

The DevTools Elements panel can be used to determine what size an image is
displayed at.

### The "Better" approach

For images with sizing based on…
- **Absolute units:** Use [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#attr-srcset) and [sizes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#attr-sizes) attributes to serve different images to different display densities. (Read the guide on Responsive Images [here](/serve-responsive-images).)

"Display density" refers to the fact that different displays have different
densities of pixels. All other things being equal, a high pixel density
display will look sharper than a low pixel density display.

As a result, multiple image versions are necessary if you want users to
experience the crispest possible images, regardless of the pixel density of
their device.

{% Aside %}
Some sites find that this difference in image quality matters, some find that it
does not.
{% endAside %}

Responsive image techniques make this possible by allowing you to list
multiple image versions and for the device to choose the image that works
best for it.

- **Relative units:** Use responsive images to serve different images to display sizes. (Read
the guide [here](/serve-responsive-images).)

An image that works across all devices will be unnecessarily large for
smaller devices. Responsive image techniques, specifically [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#attr-srcset")
and [sizes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#attr-sizes), allow you to specify multiple image versions and for the device to choose
the size that works best for it.

## Resize images

Regardless of the approach that you choose, you may find it helpful to use
ImageMagick to resize your images.
[ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) is the most popular
command line tool for creating and editing images. Most people can resize images
far more quickly when using the CLI than a GUI-based image editor.

Resize image to 25% the size of the original:

```bash
convert flower.jpg -resize 25% flower_small.jpg
```

Scale image to fit within "200px wide by 100px tall":

```bash
# macOS/Linux
convert flower.jpg -resize 200x100 flower_small.jpg

# Windows
magick convert flower.jpg -resize 200x100 flower_small.jpg
```

If you'll be resizing many images, you may find it more convenient to use a
script or service to automate the process. You can learn more about this in the
Responsive Images guide.

## Verify

Once you've resized all your images, re-run Lighthouse to verify that you didn't
miss anything.
