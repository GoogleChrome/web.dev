Consumers increasingly rely on mobile to access digital content and services, and if you look at your site analytics, you'll probably see this story playing out in your own data. Consumers are also more demanding than they've ever been, and when they weigh up the experience on your site, they aren't just comparing you with your competitors, they're rating you against the best in class services they use every day.

When it comes to user experience, speed matters. A [consumer study](https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2016/2/streaming-delays-mentally-taxing-for-smartphone-users-ericsson-mobility-report) shows that the stress response to delays in mobile speed are similar to that of watching a horror movie or solving a mathematical problem, and greater than waiting in a checkout line at a retail store. And delays caused by mobile speed aren't just frustrating, they can also have a negative impact on business results. For example, we have seen that a one-second delay in mobile load times can impact conversion rates [by up to 20%](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/advertising-channels/mobile/milliseconds-earn-millions-why-mobile-speed-can-slow-or-grow-your-business/).

  Optimizing the speed of your site can also make it accessible to audiences who are on the slowest of network connections and may not have been able to access it or access it well previously.

Many brands are already investing in mobile speed and achieving great results. In just [one example](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/success-stories/uk-success-stories/furniture-village-and-greenlight-slash-page-load-times-boosting-user-experience/), retailer Furniture Village audited their site speed and developed a plan to address the problems they found, leading to a 20% reduction in page load time and a 10% increase in conversion rate.
