**RAIL** is a **user-centric** performance model that provides a structure for
thinking about performance. The model breaks down the user's experience into key
actions (for example, tap, scroll, load) and helps you define performance goals
for each of them.

RAIL stands for four distinct aspects of web app life cycle: response,
animation, idle, and load. Users have different performance expectations for
each of these contexts, so performance goals are defined based on the context
and [UX research on how users perceive
delays](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/).

## Focus on the user

Make users the focal point of your performance effort. The table below describes
key metrics of how users perceive performance delays:

<table class="w-table-wrapper">
  <thead>
  User perception of performance delays
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>0&nbsp;to&nbsp;16&nbsp;ms</td>
    <td>Users are exceptionally good at tracking motion, and they dislike it when animations aren't smooth. They perceive animations as smooth so long as 60 new frames are rendered every second. That's 16&nbsp;ms per frame, including the time it takes for the browser to paint the new frame to the screen, leaving an app about 10&nbsp;ms to produce a frame.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0&nbsp;to&nbsp;100&nbsp;ms</td>
    <td>Respond to user actions within this time window and users feel like the result is immediate. Any longer, and the connection between action and reaction is broken.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>100&nbsp;to&nbsp;1000&nbsp;ms</td>
    <td>Within this window, things feel part of a natural and continuous progression of tasks. For most users on the web, loading pages or changing views represents a task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1000&nbsp;ms&nbsp;or&nbsp;more</td>
    <td>Beyond 1000 milliseconds (1 second), users lose focus on the task they are performing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10000&nbsp;ms or more</td>
    <td>Beyond 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds), users are frustrated and are likely to abandon tasks. They may or may not come back later.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

{% Aside %} Users perceive performance delays differently, depending on network
conditions and hardware. For example, loading sites on a powerful desktop
machine over a fast Wi-Fi connection commonly happens in under 1&nbsp;s and
users have grown accustomed to that. Loading sites on mobile devices with slow
3G connections takes more time, so mobile users are generally more patient and
loading in 5&nbsp;s on mobile is a more realistic goal. {% endAside %}

## Goals and guidelines

In the context of RAIL, the terms **goals** and **guidelines** have specific
meanings:

* **Goals**. Key performance metrics related to user experience. For example,
  tap to paint in under 100 milliseconds. Since human perception is relatively
  constant, these goals are unlikely to change any time soon.

* **Guidelines**. Recommendations that help you achieve goals. These may be
  specific to current hardware and network connection conditions, and therefore
  may change over time.

## Response: process events in under 50ms

**Goal**: Complete a transition initiated by user input within 100&nbsp;ms, so
users feel like the interactions are instantaneous.

**Guidelines**:

* To ensure a visible response within 100&nbsp;ms, process user input events
  within 50&nbsp;ms. This applies to most inputs, such as clicking buttons,
  toggling form controls, or starting animations. This does not apply to touch
  drags or scrolls.

* Though it may sound counterintuitive, it's not always the right call to
  respond to user input immediately. You can use this 100&nbsp;ms window to do
  other expensive work, but be careful not to block the user. If possible, do
  work in the background.

* For actions that take longer than 50&nbsp;ms to complete, always provide
  feedback.

### 50&nbsp;ms or 100&nbsp;ms?

The goal is to respond to input in under 100&nbsp;ms, so why is our budget only
50&nbsp;ms? This is because there is generally other work being done in addition
to input handling, and that work takes up part of the time available for
acceptable input response. If an application is performing work in the
recommended 50&nbsp;ms chunks during idle time, that means input can be queued
for up to 50&nbsp;ms if it occurs during one of those chunks of work. Accounting
for this, it's safe to assume only the remaining 50&nbsp;ms is available for
actual input handling. This effect is visualized in the diagram below which
shows how input received during an idle task is queued, reducing the available
processing time:

  <img src="./rail-response-details.png" alt="Diagram showing how input received during an idle task is queued, reducing available input processing time to 50ms">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">How idle tasks affect input response budget.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Animation: produce a frame in 10&nbsp;ms

**Goals**:

* Produce each frame in an animation in 10&nbsp;ms or less. Technically, the
  maximum budget for each frame is 16&nbsp;ms (1000&nbsp;ms / 60 frames per
  second â‰ˆ 16&nbsp;ms), but browsers need about 6&nbsp;ms to render each frame,
  hence the guideline of 10&nbsp;ms per frame.

* Aim for visual smoothness. Users notice when frame rates vary.

**Guidelines**:

* In high pressure points like animations, the key is to do nothing where you
  can, and the absolute minimum where you can't. Whenever possible, make use of
  the 100&nbsp;ms response to pre-calculate expensive work so that you maximize
  your chances of hitting 60&nbsp;fps.

* See [Rendering
  Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering)
  for various animation optimization strategies.

{% Aside %} Recognize all the types of animations. Animations aren't just fancy
UI effects. Each of these interactions are considered animations:

* Visual animations, such as entrances and exits,
  [tweens](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/T/tweening.html), and loading
  indicators.
* Scrolling. This includes flinging, which is when the user starts scrolling,
  then lets go, and the page continues scrolling.
* Dragging. Animations often follow user interactions, such as panning a map or
  pinching to zoom. {% endAside %}    

## Idle: maximize idle time

**Goal**: Maximize idle time to increase the odds that the page responds to user
input within 50&nbsp;ms.

**Guidelines**:

* Use idle time to complete deferred work. For example, for the initial page
  load, load as little data as possible, then use [idle
  time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback)
  to load the rest.

* Perform work during idle time in 50&nbsp;ms or less. Any longer, and you risk
  interfering with the app's ability to respond to user input within 50&nbsp;ms.

* If a user interacts with a page during idle time work, the user interaction
  should always take the highest priority and interrupt the idle time work.

## Load: deliver content and become interactive in under 5 seconds

When pages load slowly, user attention wanders, and users perceive the task as
broken. Sites that load quickly have [longer average sessions, lower bounce
rates, and higher ad
viewability](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/insights-inspiration/research-data/need-mobile-speed-how-mobile-latency-impacts-publisher-revenue/).

**Goals**:

* Optimize for fast loading performance relative to the device and network
  capabilities of your users. Currently, a good target for first loads is to
  load the page and be [interactive](https://web.dev/interactive/) in [5 seconds
  or less on mid-range mobile devices with slow 3G
  connections](https://web.dev/performance-budgets-101/#establish-a-baseline). 

* For subsequent loads, a good target is to load the page in under 2 seconds. 

{% Aside %}

Be aware that these targets may change over time.

{% endAside %}

**Guidelines**:

* Test your load performance on the mobile devices and network connections that
  are common among your users. You can use [Chrome User Experience
  Report](https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report/) to find out the [connection
  distribution](https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report-data-studio-dashboard/#using-the-dashboard)
  of your users. If the data is not available for your site, [The Mobile Economy
  2019](https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/) suggests that a good global
  baseline is a mid-range Android phone, such as a Moto G4, and a slow 3G
  network (defined as 400&nbsp;ms RTT and 400&nbsp;kbps transfer speed). This
  combination is available on [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/easy).

* Keep in mind that although your typical mobile user's device might claim that
  it's on a 2G, 3G, or 4G connection, in reality the [effective connection
  speed](https://web.dev/adaptive-serving-based-on-network-quality/#how-it-works)
  is often significantly slower, due to packet loss and network variance.

* [Eliminate render blocking
  resources](https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/).

* You don't have to load everything in under 5 seconds to produce the perception
  of a complete load. Consider [lazy-loading
  images](https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading/), [code-splitting JavaScript
  bundles](https://web.dev/reduce-javascript-payloads-with-code-splitting/), and
  other [optimizations suggested on web.dev](https://web.dev/fast/).

{% Aside %} Recognize the factors that affect page load performance:

* Network speed and latency
* Hardware (slower CPUs, for example)
* Cache eviction
* Differences in L2/L3 caching
* Parsing JavaScript {% endAside %}

## Tools for measuring RAIL

There are a few tools to help you automate your RAIL measurements. Which one you
use depends on what type of information you need, and what type of workflow you
prefer.

### Chrome DevTools

[Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
provides in-depth analysis on everything that happens while your page loads or
runs. See [Get Started With Analyzing Runtime
Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance)
to get familiar with the **Performance** panel UI.

The following DevTools features are especially relevant:

* [Throttle your
  CPU](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#cpu-throttle)
  to simulate a less-powerful device.

* [Throttle the
  network](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#network-throttle)
  to simulate slower connections.

* [View main thread
  activity](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#main)
  to view every event that occurred on the main thread while you were recording.

* [View main thread activities in a
  table](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#activities)
  to sort activities based on which ones took up the most time.

* [Analyze frames per second
  (FPS)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#fps)
  to measure whether your animations truly run smoothly.

* [Monitor CPU usage, JS heap size, DOM nodes, layouts per second, and
  more](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/devtools-release-notes#perf-monitor)
  in real-time with the **Performance Monitor**.

* [Visualize network
  requests](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#network)
  that occurred while you were recording with the **Network** section.

* [Capture screenshots while
  recording](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#screenshots)
  to play back exactly how the page looked while the page loaded, or an
  animation fired, and so on.

* [View
  interactions](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#interactions)
  to quickly identify what happened on a page after a user interacted with it.

* [Find scroll performance issues in
  real-time](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#scrolling-performance-issues)
  by highlighting the page whenever a potentially problematic listener fires.

* [View paint events in
  real-time](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference#paint-flashing)
  to identify costly paint events that may be harming the performance of your
  animations.

### Lighthouse

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) is available in
Chrome DevTools,  at [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure/), as a
Chrome Extension, as a Node.js module, and within WebPageTest. You give it a
URL, it simulates a mid-range device with a slow 3G connection, runs a series of
audits on the page, and then gives you a report on load performance, as well as
suggestions on how to improve. 

The following audits are especially relevant:

**Response**

* [Max Potential First Input
  Delay](https://web.dev/lighthouse-max-potential-fid/). Estimates how long your
  app will take to respond to user input, based on main thread idle time.

* [Does not use passive listeners to improve scrolling
  performance](https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/).

* [Total Blocking Time](https://web.dev/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/).
  Measures the total amount of time that a page is blocked from responding to
  user input, such as mouse clicks, screen taps, or keyboard presses. 

* [Time To
  Interactive](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/consistently-interactive).
  Measures when a user can consistently interact with all page elements.

**Load**

* [Does not register a service worker that controls page and
  start_url](https://web.dev/service-worker/). A service worker can cache common
  resources on a user's device, reducing time spent fetching resources over the
  network.

* [Page load is not fast enough on mobile
  networks](https://web.dev/load-fast-enough-for-pwa/).

* [Eliminate render-blocking
  resources](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/blocking-resources).

* [Defer offscreen images](https://web.dev/offscreen-images/). Defer the loading
  of offscreen images until they're needed.

* [Properly size images](https://web.dev/uses-responsive-images/). Don't serve
  images that are significantly larger than the size that's rendered in the
  mobile viewport.

* [Avoid chaining critical requests](https://web.dev/critical-request-chains/). 

* [Does not use HTTP/2 for all of its resources](https://web.dev/uses-http2/).

* [Efficiently encode images](https://web.dev/uses-optimized-images/).

* [Enable text compression](https://web.dev/uses-text-compression/).

* [Avoid enormous network payloads](https://web.dev/total-byte-weight/).

* [Avoid an excessive DOM size](https://web.dev/dom-size/). Reduce network bytes
  by only shipping DOM nodes that are needed for rendering the page.

### WebPageTest

WebPageTest is a web performance tool that uses real browsers to access web
pages and collect timing metrics. Enter a URL at
[webpagetest.org/easy](https://webpagetest.org/easy) to get a detailed report on
the page's load performance on a real Moto G4 device with a slow 3G connection.
You can also configure it to include a Lighthouse audit.

## Summary

RAIL is a lens for looking at a website's user experience as a journey composed
of distinct interactions. Understand how users perceive your site in order to
set performance goals with the greatest impact on user experience.

* Focus on the user.

* Respond to user input in under 100&nbsp;ms.

* Produce a frame in under 10&nbsp;ms when animating or scrolling.

* Maximize main thread idle time.

* Load interactive content in under 5000&nbsp;ms.
