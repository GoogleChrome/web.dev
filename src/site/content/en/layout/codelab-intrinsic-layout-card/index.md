**Here's a codelab** with all the work done that's not layout related. What you need to do now is **code a resilient layout**.

## Requirements
1. Title should be capable of handling very long or very short messages
2. Logo should be optional
3. Subtitle should be optional
4. Subtitle should be capable of handling very long or very short messages
5. Image is optional

<br>

## Bonus
1. The comp has the image aligned to top, center yours so it's more elegant when tall
2. Looks great down to mobile without any media queries

<br>

## 💡 Tips
1. Where do you see margins that shouldn't exist if there's no other elements around?
1. Perhaps you'll need to mix flex and grid
1. Don't tell that image how tall to be, you don't know what other deals there will be later
