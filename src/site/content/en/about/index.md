  summary:
    - paragraph: Explore our archive of content, covering subjects across the web development stack. You’ll find the latest news and content on our <a href="/blog/">blog</a>, and you can discover content by groups on the explore page.
    - paragraph: For complete courses on key web development topics, check out <a href="/learn/">Learn</a>. Industry experts have developed these courses to take you right through a subject. They are structured to allow you to just dip into one or two modules of interest too.
    - paragraph: Want some grab and go code? Our <a href="/patterns/">Patterns</a> break down common web development requirements, whether you want to understand how to approach a certain UI component, or need to know how to copy an image to the <a href="/patterns/clipboard/">clipboard</a>, you’ll find a solution there.
    - paragraph: To help you make a case for work on UI or Performance, we have <a href="/tags/case-study/">case studies</a>. Find out how other companies have used metrics such as Core Web Vitals to see real results. And, if that’s quite enough reading for one day we also have a great archive of <a href="/podcasts/">podcasts</a> and other <a href="/shows/">shows</a>, plus recordings of our <a href="/spaces/">Twitter Space</a> sessions with members of the Chrome team.
    - paragraph: We believe that a web with multiple browser engines is important, and that web sites and applications should work well no matter which browser your visitors use. We know that you care about that too, and so content on this site should have cross-browser status clearly explained. You’ll see that many articles have a component showing browser support—the data comes from our friends at MDN, via the Browser Compat Data project that powers the data on MDN pages.
