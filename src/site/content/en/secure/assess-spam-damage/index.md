This step is for sites hacked to host spam, often with the warning
_"This site may be hacked"_ displayed in search results. It's one of the

If your site was affected by malware and is flagged with the warning
_"This site may harm your computer"_ in search results, see the
corresponding article,
[Assess malware damage (Hacked with malware)](/secure/hacked-with-malware/).
