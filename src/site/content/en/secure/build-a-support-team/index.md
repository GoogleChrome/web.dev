## You'll need

The ability to contact your hoster.

## Tell your hoster that your site has been compromised

Your hoster can make sure their other customers weren't affected, and they can
potentially help recover your site.

## Locate reputable online resources and helpful communities

Your goal is to find out where to turn if you have problems with the recovery
process. In addition to this series of articles and your hoster's
help system, try searching and reading responses in discussion forums or even
posting a question yourself.

[Google Search Central](https://developers.google.com/search)'s discussion
forum has a special subforum for
[Malware and hacked sites](https://support.google.com/webmasters/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=(category:security_malware_hacked)).
Most responses come from highly engaged members and the community's
[Product Experts](https://productexperts.withgoogle.com/).

## Determine if this is something you can handle yourself

Fixing the site yourself requires the ability to read and understand code, how
to use command-line server tools, possibly how to change web server
configurations for your site. If you feel ill-equipped to do this yourself,
consider enlisting a qualified professional to help you.

Here are some tips for finding a qualified professional:

* Seek referrals from the standout members of reputable online communities.
* Transfer your site to new hoster who specializes in site recovery and can
  recover your site as part of the transfer.
