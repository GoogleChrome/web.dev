  A browser can load and display resources from multiple sites. If there is no
  restriction on interactions between those resources, and if a script is
  compromised by an attacker, the script could expose everything on a user's
  browser.

The same-origin policy is a browser security feature that restricts how
documents and scripts on one origin can interact with resources
on another origin.

A browser can load and display resources from multiple sites at once. You might have
multiple tabs open at the same time, or a site could embed multiple iframes from
different sites. If there is no restriction on interactions between these
resources, and a script is compromised by an attacker, the script could
expose everything in a user's browser.

The same-origin policy prevents this from happening by blocking read access to
resources loaded from a different origin. "But wait," you say, "I load images
and scripts from other origins _all the time_." Browsers allow a few tags to
embed resources from a different origin. This policy is mostly a historical
artifact and can expose your site to vulnerabilities such as [clickjacking using
iframes](#how-to-prevent-clickjacking). You can restrict cross-origin reading
of these tags using a [Content Security
Policy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp/).

## What's considered same-origin?

An origin is defined by the scheme (also known as the  protocol, for example
HTTP or HTTPS), port (if it is specified), and host. When all three are the same
for two URLs, they are considered same-origin. For example,
`http://www.example.com/foo` is the same origin as
<code><strong>http</strong>://www.example.com/bar</code>
but not <code><strong>https</strong>://www.example.com/bar</code>
because the scheme is different.

## What is permitted and what is blocked?

Generally, embedding a cross-origin resource is permitted, while reading a
cross-origin resource is blocked.

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>iframes</td>
      <td>
        Cross-origin embedding is usually permitted (depending on the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options" rel="noopener">X-Frame-Options</a></code> directive), but cross-origin reading (such as using JavaScript to access a document in an iframe) isn't.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CSS</td>
      <td>
        Cross-origin CSS can be embedded using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element or an <code>@import</code> in a CSS file. The correct <code>Content-Type</code> header may be required.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>forms</td>
      <td>
        Cross-origin URLs can be used as the <code>action</code> attribute value of form elements. A web application can write form data to a cross-origin destination.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>images</td>
      <td>
        Embedding cross-origin images is permitted. However, reading cross-origin images (such as loading a cross-origin image into a <code>canvas</code> element using JavaScript) is blocked.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>multimedia</td>
      <td>
        Cross-origin video and audio can be embedded using <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>script</td>
      <td>
        Cross-origin scripts can be embedded; however, access to certain APIs (such as cross-origin fetch requests) might be blocked.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

{% AssessmentCallout 'Use the drop-down below each cross-origin resource to check whether the specified action is allowed.' %}
{% Tabs 'Samples for knowledge self check' %}
{% Tab 'sample' %}

A webpage on the web.dev domain includes this iframe:

```html
<iframe id="iframe" src="https://example.com/some-page.html" alt="Sample iframe"></iframe>
```

The webpage's JavaScript includes this code to get the text content from an element in the embedded page:

```html
const iframe = document.getElementById('iframe');
const message = iframe.contentDocument.getElementById('message').innerText;
```

{% AssessmentHint 'Is this JavaScript allowed?' %}
**No**. Since the iframe is not on the same origin as the host webpage,
the browser doesn't allow reading of the embedded page.
{% endAssessmentHint %}

{% endTab %}
{% Tab 'sample' %}

A webpage on the web.dev domain includes this form:

```html
<form action="https://example.com/results.json">
  <label for="email">Enter your email: </label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>
  <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
</form>
```

{% AssessmentHint 'Can this form be submitted?' %}
**Yes**. Form data can be written to a cross-origin URL specified
in the `action` attribute of the `<form>` element.
{% endAssessmentHint %}

{% endTab %}
{% Tab 'sample' %}

A webpage on the web.dev domain includes this iframe:

```html
<iframe src="https://example.com/some-page.html" alt="Sample iframe"></iframe>
```

{% AssessmentHint 'Is this iframe embed allowed?' %}
**Usually**. Cross-origin iframe embeds are allowed
as long as the origin owner hasn't set the
[`X-Frame-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options)
HTTP header to `deny` or `sameorigin`.
{% endAssessmentHint %}

{% endTab %}
{% Tab 'sample' %}

A webpage on the web.dev domain includes this canvas:

```html
<canvas id="bargraph"></canvas>
```

The webpage's JavaScript includes this code to draw an image on the canvas:

```js
var context = document.getElementById('bargraph').getContext('2d');
var img = new Image();
img.onload = function() {
  context.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
};
img.src = 'https://example.com/graph-axes.svg';
```

{% AssessmentHint 'Can this image be drawn on the canvas?' %}
**It depends!** ðŸ˜… The image is on a different origin.
If the origin's owner gave the image the appropriate
[CORS header](/cross-origin-resource-sharing),
the image can be safely drawn. If not, the image will
[cause an error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image#What_is_a_.22tainted.22_canvas.3F).

### How to prevent Clickjacking

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--inline-right">
  <img src="./clickjacking.png" alt="clickjacking">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Figure: Clickjacking mechanism illustrated in 3 separate layers (base site,
    iframed site, transparent button).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

An attack called "clickjacking" embeds a site in an `iframe` and overlays
transparent buttons which link to a different destination. Users are tricked
into thinking they are accessing your application while sending data to
attackers.

To block other sites from embedding your site in an iframe, add a content
security policy with [`frame-ancestors`
directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors)
to the HTTP headers.

Alternatively, you can add `X-Frame-Options` to the HTTP headers see
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options)
for list of options.

## Wrap up

Hopefully you feel a little relieved that browsers work hard to be a gatekeeper
of security on the web. Even though browsers try to be safe by blocking access
to resources, sometimes you want to access cross-origin resources in your
applications. In the next guide, learn about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) and how to tell the browser that loading of cross-origin resources is
allowed from trusted sources.
