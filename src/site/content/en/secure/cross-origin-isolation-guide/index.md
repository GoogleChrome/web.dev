This guide shows you how to enable cross-origin isolation. Cross-origin
isolation is required if you want to use
[SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer),
[`performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()`](/monitor-total-page-memory-usage/),
or the JS Self-Profiling API.

{% Aside 'objective' %}
If you landed this page by a SharedArrayBuffer deprecation message, it's likely
either your website or one of the resources you emebed to your website is using
SharedArrayBuffer. When Chrome hits 91, the functionality that has been
available through SharedArrayBuffer will no longer work. take one of the
following actions to fix the issue in advance.

* Turn on the cross-origin isolation to keep using SharedArrayBuffer.
* Notify the third-party that actually uses SharedArrayBuffer to take action.
{% endAside %}

## Determine where in your website a SharedArrayBuffer is used

If you are not sure where in your site a SharedArrayBuffer is used, there are
two ways:

* Using Chrome DevTools
* Using Deprecation Reporting

Skip to [Do an impact analysis](:analysis) if you already know where you are
using SharedArrayBuffer.

### Using Chrome DevTools

Chrome has a tool for developers to inspect the website. You can identify the
issue using it.

1. [Open the Chrome
   DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on
   the page you suspect it might be using a SharedArrayBuffer.
2. Select the **Console** panel.
3. The following message will show up if SharedArrayBuffer is used:
      ```text
      [Deprecation] SharedArrayBuffer will require cross-origin isolation as of M91, around May 2021. See https://developer.chrome.com/blog/enabling-shared-array-buffer/ for more details. common-bundle.js:535
      ```
4. The filename and the line number indicates where the SharedArrayBuffer comes
   from. If it's a third-party library, please contact the developer to fix the
   issue. If it's implemented as part of your website, follow the guide below to
   enable cross-origin isolation.

### Using Deprecation Reporting

Some browsers have [a reporting functionality of deprecating
APIs](https://wicg.github.io/deprecation-reporting/) to a specified endpoint.

1. [Set up a deprecation report server and get the reporting
   URL](/coop-coep/#set-up-reporting-endpoint). You can achieve this by either
   finding a public service or building one by yourself.
2. Using the URL, set the following HTTP header to pages that are potentially
   serving SharedArrayBuffer usage.
      ```http
      Report-To: {"group":"default","max_age":86400,"endpoints":[{"url":"THE_DEPRECATION_ENDPOINT_URL"}]}
      ```
3. Once the header starts to propagate, the endpoint you registered to should
   start collecting deprecation reports.

See an example implementation here:
[https://first-party-test.glitch.me](https://first-party-test.glitch.me)

## Do an impact analysis {: #analysis}

Wouldn't it be great if you could assess the impact that enabling cross-origin
isolation would have on your site without actually breaking anything? The
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy-Report-Only` and
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only` HTTP headers allow you to do just
that.

1. Set [`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy-Report-Only:
   same-origin`](/coop-coep/#1.-set-the-cross-origin-opener-policy:-same-origin-header-on-the-top-level-document)
   on your top-level document. As the name indicates, this header only sends
   reports about the impact that `COOP: same-origin` **would** have on your
   siteâ€”it won't actually disable communication with popup windows.
2. Set up reporting and configure a web server to receive and save the reports.
3. Set [`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only:
   require-corp`](/coop-coep/#3.-use-the-coep-report-only-http-header-to-assess-embedded-resources)
   on your top-level document. Again, this header lets you see the impact of
   enabling `COEP: require-corp` without actually affecting your site's
   functioning yet. You can configure this header to send reports to the same
   reporting server that you set up in the previous step.

{% Aside %}
You can also [enable the **Domain**
column](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network#information)
in Chrome DevTools **Network** panel to get a general view of which resources
would be impacted.
{% endAside %}

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Enabling cross-origin isolation will block the loading of cross-origin resources
that you don't explicitly opt-in, and it will prevent your top-level document
from being able to communicate with popup windows.
{% endAside %}

## Mitigate the impact of cross-origin isolation

After you have determined which resources will be affected by cross-origin
isolation, here are general guidelines for how you actually opt-in those
cross-origin resources:

1. On cross-origin resources loaded into iframes, set the
   `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only: require-corp` header to do an
   impact analysis.
2. On cross-origin resources such as images, scripts, stylesheets, iframes, and
   others, set the [`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy:
   cross-origin`](https://resourcepolicy.fyi/#cross-origin) header. On same-site
   resources, set [`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy:
   same-site`](https://resourcepolicy.fyi/#same-origin) header.
3. Set the `crossorigin` attribute in the HTML tag on top-level document if the
   resource is served with [CORS](/cross-origin-resource-sharing/) (for example,
   `<img src="example.jpg" crossorigin>`).
4. If cross-origin resources loaded into iframes involve another layer of
   iframes, recursively apply steps described in this section before moving
   forward.
5. Once you confirm that all cross-origin resources are opted-in, set the
   `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` header on the cross-origin
   resources loaded into iframes.
6. Make sure there are no cross-origin popup windows that require communication
   through `postMessage()`. There's no way to keep them working when
   cross-origin isolation is enabled. You can move the communication to another
   document that isn't cross-origin isolated, or use a different communication
   method (for example, HTTP requests).

## Enable cross-origin isolation

After you have mitigated the impact by cross-origin isolation, here are general
guidelines to enable cross-origin isolation:

1. Set the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` header on your top-level
   document. If you had set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy-Report-Only:
   same-origin`, replace it. This blocks communication between your top-level
   document and its popup windows.
2. Set the `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` header on your top-level
   document. If you had set `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy-Report-Only:
   require-corp`, replace it. This will block the loading of cross-origin
   resources that are not opted-in.
3. Check that `self.crossOriginIsolated` returns `true` in console to verify
   that your page is cross-origin isolated.
