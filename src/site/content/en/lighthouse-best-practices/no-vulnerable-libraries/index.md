Intruders have automated web crawlers that can scan your site
for known security vulnerabilities.
When the web crawler detects a vulnerability,
it alerts the intruder.
From there,
the intruder just needs to figure out how to exploit the vulnerability on your site.

## How this Lighthouse audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) flags front-end JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="no-vulnerable-libraries.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing any front-end JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities used by the page">
</figure>

To detect vulnerable libraries, Lighthouse:

- Runs [Library Detector For Chrome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-library-detector).
- Checks the list of detected libraries against
[snyk's Vulnerability DB](https://snyk.io/vuln?packageManager=all).

{% include 'content/lighthouse-best-practices/scoring.njk' %}

## Stop using insecure JavaScript libraries

Stop using each of the libraries that Lighthouse flags.
If the library has released a newer version that fixes the vulnerability,
upgrade to that version.
If the library hasn't released a new version or is no longer maintained,
consider using a different library.

Click the links in the **Library Version** column of your report to learn more about
each library's vulnerabilities.
