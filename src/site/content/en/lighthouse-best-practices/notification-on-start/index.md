Good notifications are [timely, relevant, and precise](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/).
If your page asks for permission to send notifications on page load,
those notifications may not be relevant to your users or their needs.

## How the Lighthouse notification audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) flags pages that request notification permissions on load:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="notification-on-start.png" alt="Lighthouse audit shows page requests notification permissions on load">
</figure>

Lighthouse checks all JavaScript executed on page load.
If the code calls `notification.requestPermission()`,
and notification permission has not already been granted, the audit fails.

If notification permission was granted to a page before the audit,
Lighthouse can't identify any notification permission requests.
So, make sure to [reset permissions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6148059)
before running the audit.

Lighthouse reports the URL and line number
of each request for notification permission.

## How to ask for users' notification permissions responsibly
Remove all calls to `notification.requestPermission()`
that occur on page load.

To provide a better user experience:
- Offer to send users a specific type of notification.
- Present the permissions request after users opt in to the notification type.
