Deprecated APIs are scheduled to be removed from Chrome.
Calling these APIs
after they're removed causes errors on your site.
Lighthouse flags the deprecated APIs:

## How this audit fails

Lighthouse collects the deprecated API warnings that Chrome logs
to the DevTools Console and includes them in the Lighthouse repot as warnings.

## How to remove deprecated APIs.

Go to
[Chrome Platform Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#deprecated) and
expand the entries for the APIs that you're using
to learn more about why the APIs are deprecated,
as well as how to replace them.
