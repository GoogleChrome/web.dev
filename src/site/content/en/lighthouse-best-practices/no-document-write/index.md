For users on slow connections,
such as 2G, 3G, or slow Wi-Fi,
external scripts dynamically injected via `document.write()`
can delay the display of main page content by tens of seconds.
Lighthouse lists out every call to `document.write()`:

  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">

## How this audit fails

Lighthouse reports every instance of `document.write()` that it encounters.
Chrome's intervention against `document.write()` only applies
to render-blocking, dynamically-injected scripts.
Other uses of `document.write()` may be acceptable.

## Avoid `document.write()`

Review the usage of `document.write()`.
If the script meets the criteria outlined in the introduction to
[Intervening against `document.write()`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/08/removing-document-write), 
Chrome won't execute the injected script.
These are the calls to `document.write()` that you want to change.

See [How do I fix this?](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/08/removing-document-write#how_do_i_fix_this) for possible solutions.
