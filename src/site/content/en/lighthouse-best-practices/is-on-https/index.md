All websites should be protected with HTTPS,
even ones that don't handle sensitive data.
HTTPS prevents intruders from tampering with or passively listening in
on the communications between your site and your users.
Lighthouse flags pages that don't use HTTPS:

  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

## How this audit fails

Lighthouse waits for an event from the Chrome Debugger Protocol
indicating that the page is running on a secure connection.
If the event is not heard within 10 seconds,
the audit fails.

## How to migrate your site to HTTPS

Many hosting platforms, such as
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) or
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), are secure by default.

If you're running your own servers and need a cheap and easy way
to generate certificates,
check out [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
For more help on enabling HTTPS on your servers,
see the following set of docs:
[Encrypting data in transit](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/enable-https).

If your page is already running on HTTPS but you're failing this audit,
then you may have problems with mixed content.
Mixed content is when a secure site requests an unprotected (HTTP) resource.
Check out the following doc on the Chrome DevTools Security panel
to learn how to debug these situations:
[Understand security issues](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/security).

## Platform features require HTTPS

HTTPS is a prerequisite for many new, powerful web platform features,
such as taking pictures or recording audio.

By definition,
an app cannot qualify as a progressive web app if it does not run on HTTPS.
This is because many core progressive web app technologies,
such as service workers, require HTTPS.

For more information on why all sites should be protected with HTTPS, see
[Why You Should Always Use HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https).
