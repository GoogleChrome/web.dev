[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) lists all front-end JavaScript libraries detected on the page:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="js-libraries.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing all front-end JavaScript libraries detected on page">
</figure>

## This is a diagnostic audit

This audit simply lists all the front-end JavaScript libraries your page uses.

Lighthouse also reports
[front-end JavaScript libraries with known security risks](/no-vulnerable-libraries).
Make sure to update any insecure libraries.
