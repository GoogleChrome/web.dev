Users are mistrustful of or confused by pages
that automatically request their location on page load.

## How the Lighthouse geolocation audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) flags pages that request geolocation permission on load:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="geolocation-on-start.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing geolocation request on page load">
</figure>

Lighthouse checks all JavaScript executed on page load.
If the code calls `geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` or `geolocation.watchPosition()`,
and geolocation permission has not already been granted, the audit fails.

If geolocation permission was granted to a page before the audit,
Lighthouse can't identify any geolocation permission requests.
So, make sure to [reset permissions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6148059)
before running the audit.

Lighthouse reports the URL and line number
of each request for geolocation permission.

## How to ask for users' locations responsibly
Remove all calls to `geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` and
`geolocation.watchPosition()` that occur on page load.

To provide a better user experience:
- Always request geolocation permission after a user action,
not on page load.
- Clearly indicate that the action will request geolocation permission.
- Assume users won't give you their locations.
- Use a fallback if users don't grant geolocation permission.
