Specifying a doctype prevents the browser from switching to
[quirks mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode),
which can cause your page to [render in unexpected ways](https://quirks.spec.whatwg.org/#css).

## How the Lighthouse doctype audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) flags pages without the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration:

<figure class="w-figure">
  {% Img src="image/tcFciHGuF3MxnTr1y5ue01OGLBn2/l6IEjHdtgCa45QimENjb.png", alt="Lighthouse audit showing missing doctype", width="800", height="76", class="w-screenshot" %}
</figure>

{% include 'content/lighthouse-best-practices/scoring.njk' %}

## How to add a doctype declaration

Add the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to the top of your HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
â€¦
```

See MDN's [Doctype](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Doctype)
page for more information.
