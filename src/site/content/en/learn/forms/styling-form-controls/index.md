In this module you learn how to style `<form>` elements, and how to match your other site styles. 

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Styling HTML form controls can be a challenge, 
but you should still use built-in elements wherever possible. 
Elements such as `<input>` and `<button>` are widely supported across browsers and platforms, 
and have built-in features that enhance usability and accessibility, 
which you don't need to implement yourself. Using a `<div>` instead doesn't provide these benefits.

## Help users select an option

### The `<select>` element

The default styles of a `<select>` element don't look great, and the appearance is inconsistent between browsers. 

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'eea33ada7ec976aa5791a5cd14756c34',
  height: 300
} %}

{% Aside %}
You can also use an `<input>` in combination with the 
[`<datalist>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) element. 
This gives you a combination of a text field and a list of `<option>` elements. 
You can see examples of [`<datalist>`](http://simpl.info/datalist) here.
{% endAside %}

First, let's change the arrows. 

```css
select {
    -moz-appearance: none;
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    appearance: none;
    background-color: #fff;
    background-image: url(arrow.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right .7em top 50%, 0 0;
    background-size: .65em auto;
}
```

To remove the default arrows of a `<select>` element, 
use the CSS [`appearance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/appearance) property. 
To show the arrow of your choice, define the arrow as a `background`.

{% Aside %}
To ensure the best cross-browser compatibility, 
you must also include the prefixed versions of `appearance`: `-moz-appearance` and `-webkit-appearance`. 

[Learn more about vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix#css_prefixes).
{% endAside %}

You should also change the `font-size` to at least `1rem` 
(which for most browsers has a default value of 16px) for your `<select>` element. 
This prevents a page zoom on iOS Safari when a form control is focused.

You can, of course, also change the element colors to match your brand colors. 
After adding some more styles for spacing, `:hover`, and `:focus`, 
the appearance of the `<select>` element is now consistent between browsers. 

See this in the following demo from 
[Styling a Select Like Itâ€™s 2019](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/select-css.html)

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: '2f6101907a292463bccd8d7a72d09554',
  height: 300
} %}

What about the `<option>` element? The `<option>` element is a so-called 
[replaced element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element) whose representation is outside the scope of CSS. 
As of this writing, you can't style the `<option>` element.

{% Aside %}
There is an ongoing proposal to allow web developers to style and extend built-in web UI controls, 
including `<select>` and `<option>` elements. This would make it easier to style form controls in the future.

### Checkboxes and Radio buttons

The appearance of `<input type="checkbox">` and `<input type="radio">` varies across browsers. 

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: '74d28931d0c0e9aacc89f62380f365e4',
  height: 400
} %}

Open the [demo](https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/74d28931d0c0e9aacc89f62380f365e4) on various browsers to see the difference. 
Let's see how to make sure that checkboxes and radio buttons match your brand and look the same cross-browser.

You can't style `<input type="checkbox">` and `<input type="radio">` directly, 
but there is a workaround. 
First, hide the default checkbox and radio button visually.

```css
input[type="radio"],
input[type="checkbox"] {
   position: absolute;
   opacity: 0;
}
```

Use `position: absolute` in combination with `opacity: 0` instead of `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` 
to only hide the elements visually, 
and to ensure they are still present in the 
[accessibility tree](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-builtin/the-accessibility-tree). 

To show your custom checkboxes and radio buttons, you have different options. 
You use the `:before` CSS pseudo-element and the CSS `background` property, or use inline SVG images. 

```css
input[type="radio"] + label:before {
  content: "";
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  border: 1px solid black;
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 50%;
  margin-inline-end: 0.5em;
}

input[type="radio"]:checked + label:before {
  background: black;
}
```

{% Aside %}
Styled form controls must be easy to understand and use. People are used to a checkbox that looks 
like a checkbox, so make sure when you style a form control that users still understand how to use it. 
{% endAside %}

There are a lot of possibilities with CSS to ensure checkboxes and radio buttons match your brand styles.

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: '433b6d50b9d7d706e31ee5a638790c3d',
  height: 400
} %}

and [custom checkbox styles](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style/).

## How to use your site's colors for form controls

Do you want to bring your site styles to form controls with one line of code? 
You can use the [`accent-color`](/accent-color/) CSS property to achieve this.

```css
checkbox {
  accent-color: orange;
}
```

{% Aside %}
As of this writing, only Chrome, Firefox and Edge support `accent-color`. 
To ensure cross-browser compatibility, 
you might want to use workarounds until `accent-color` is supported in all platforms.
