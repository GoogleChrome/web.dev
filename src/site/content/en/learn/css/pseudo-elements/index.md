If you've got an article of content
and you want the first letter to be a much bigger drop cap—
how do you achieve that?

{% Img
src="image/VbAJIREinuYvovrBzzvEyZOpw5w1/Qpo2f3eRInt5iM6qW2p2.svg",
alt="A couple of paragraphs of text with a blue drop cap",
width="800",
height="318" %}

In CSS,
you can use the `::first-letter` pseudo-element to achieve this sort of design detail.

```css
p::first-letter {
  color: blue;
  float: left;
  font-size: 2.6em;
  font-weight: bold;
  line-height: 1;
  margin-inline-end: 0.2rem;
}
```

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'PoWjybP'
} %}

A pseudo-element is like adding or targeting an extra element without having to add more HTML.
This example solution, using `::first-letter`,
is one of many pseudo-elements.
They have a range of roles,
and in this lesson you're going to learn which pseudo-elements are available and how you can use them.

## `::before` and `::after`

Both the
[`::before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and
[`::after`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::after)
pseudo-elements create a child element inside an element **only** if you define a `content` property.

```css
.my-element::before {
	content: "";
}

.my-element::after {
	content: "";
}
```

The `content` can be any string
—even an empty one—
but be mindful that anything other than an empty string will likely be announced by a screen reader.
You can add an image `url`,
which will insert an image at its original dimensions,
so you won't be able to resize it.
You can also insert a
[`counter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/counter()).

{% Aside 'key-term' %}
You can create a named counter and then increment it,
based on it's position in the document flow.
There's all sorts of contexts where they can be really useful, such as automatically numbering an outline.
{% endAside %}

Once a `::before` or `::after` element has been created,
you can style it however you want with no limits.
You can only insert a `::before` or `::after` element to an element that will accept child elements
([elements with a document tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html)),
so elements such as `<img />`, `<video>` and `<input>` won't work.

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'GRrEYrg'
} %}

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
`input[type="checkbox"]` is an exception. 
It is allowed to have pseudo-element children.
{% endAside %}

## `::first-letter`

We met this pseudo-element at the start of the lesson.
It is worth being aware that not all CSS properties can be used when targeting
[`::first-letter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::first-letter).
The available properties are:

- `color`
- `background` properties (such as `background-image`)
- `border` properties (such as `border-color`)
- `float`
- `font` properties (such as `font-size` and `font-weight`)
- text properties (such as `text-decoration` and `word-spacing`)

```css
p::first-letter {
  color: goldenrod;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'JjEJmOx'
} %}

{% Aside %}
You can only use `:first-letter` on block containers.
Therefore, it won't work if you try to add it to an element that has `display: inline`.
{% endAside %}

## `::first-line`

The [`::first-line`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::first-line)
pseudo-element will let you style the first line of text
only if the element with `::first-line` applied has a `display` value of `block`,
`inline-block`, `list-item`, `table-caption` or `table-cell`.

```css
p::first-line {
  color: goldenrod;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'vYgZVaO'
} %}

Like the `::first-letter` pseudo-element,
there's only a subset of CSS properties you can use:

- `color`
- `background` properties
- `font` properties
- `text` properties

## `::backdrop`

If you have an element that is presented in full screen mode,
such as a `<dialog>` or a `<video>`,
you can style the backdrop—the space between the element and the rest of the page—with the
[`::backdrop`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) pseudo-element:


```css
video::backdrop {
  background-color: goldenrod;
}
```

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'rNjwqRQ'
} %}

The `::backdrop` pseudo-element is supported in all major browsers apart from Safari.

## `::marker`

The [`::marker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::marker)
pseudo-element lets you style the bullet or number for a list item or the arrow of a `<summary>` element.

```css
::marker {
  color: hotpink;
}

ul ::marker {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

ol ::marker {
  font-size: 1.1em;
}

summary::marker {
  content: '\002B'' '; /* Plus symbol with space */
}

details[open] summary::marker {
  content: '\2212'' '; /* Minus symbol with space */
}
```

Only a small subset of CSS properties are supported for `::marker`:

- `color`
- `content`
- `white-space`
- `font` properties
- `animation` and `transition` properties

You can change the marker symbol, using the `content` property. You can use this to set a plus and minus symbol for the closed and empty states of a `<summary>` element, for example.

  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'MWJozrR'
} %}

## `::selection`

The [`::selection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::selection)
pseudo-element allows you to style how selected text looks.

```css
::selection {
  background: green;
  color: white;
}
```

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'JjEJeZK'
} %}

This pseudo-element can be used to style all selected text as in the above demo.
It can also be used in combination with other selectors for a more specific selection style.

```css
p:nth-of-type(2)::selection {
  background: darkblue;
  color: yellow;
}
```

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'MWJozXM'
} %}

As with other pseudo-elements, only a subset of CSS properties are allowed:

- `color`
- `background-color` but **not** `background-image`
- `text` properties

## `::placeholder`

You can add a helper hint to form elements,
such as `<input>` with a `placeholder` attribute.
The [`::placeholder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::placeholder)
pseudo-element allows you to style that text.

```css
input::placeholder {
  color: darkcyan;
}
```

{% Codepen {
  user: 'web-dot-dev',
  id: 'KKaqrrY'
} %}

The `::placeholder` only supports a subset of CSS rules:

- `color`
- `background` properties
- `font` properties
- `text` properties

{% Aside %}
A `placeholder` is not `<label>`
and should not be used in place of a `<label>`.
Form elements must be labelled or they will be inaccessible.
{% endAside %}

## `::cue`

Last in this tour of pseudo-elements is the
[`::cue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::cue) pseudo-element.
This allows you to style the WebVTT cues,
which are the captions of a `<video>` element.

You can also pass a selector into a `::cue`,
which allows you to style specific elements _inside_ a caption.

```css
video::cue {
  color: yellow;
}

video::cue(b) {
  color: red;
}

video::cue(i) {
  color: lightpink;
}
```
