**Welcome to Learn CSS!**

This course breaks down the fundamentals of CSS into digestible,
easy to understand parts.
Over the next few modules,
you will learn how the core aspects of CSS work and how to use them effectively in your projects.

You'll learn CSS fundamentals like the box model, cascade and specificity, flexbox, grid and z-index.
And, along with these fundamentals,
you'll learn about functions, color types, gradients, logical properties and inheritance
to make you a well-rounded front-end developer,
ready to take on any user interface.

Each module is full of interactive demos and self-assessments for you to explore and test your knowledge.
In addition to learning through reading and demos,
each module contains an accompanying podcast episode as another way to learn and expand your knowledge.

This course is created for beginner and advanced CSS developers alike.
You can go through the series of modules from start to finish
to get a well-rounded understanding of CSS from top to bottom,
or you can use it as a reference for specific styling subjects.
