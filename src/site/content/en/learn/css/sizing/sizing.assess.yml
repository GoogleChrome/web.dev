    stem: How are absolute and relative units different?
    options:
      - content: "Absolute values can't change but relative units can"
        rationale: "Absolute values can change, but the base they
        calculate against can't."
      - content: "An absolute length is calculated against a single shared base
      value, where a relative unit is compared against a base value that can change."
        rationale: "Relative units are more adaptive and fluid because of their
        contextual awareness, but there's a power and predictability to absolute
        units that can be foundational for certain designs."

    stem: Viewport units are absolute.
    options:
      - content: "True"
        rationale: "They may feel absolute, but they're relative to a viewport,
        which could be an iframe or webview, and isn't always representative of
        a device screen size."
      - content: "False"
        rationale: "They are relative to the document window they were created
        in, which may or may not be the same as a device screen."
