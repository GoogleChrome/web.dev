      ```css

        width: 200px;
        border: 10px solid;
        padding: 20px;

    stem: How wide do you think `.my-box` will be?
    options:
      - content: 200px
        rationale: |
          Since the default value for box-sizing is content-box, padding and
          borders will be added to the width. `200px` would be correct if the 
          box had `box-sizing: border-box`.
      - content: 260px
        rationale: |
          The default box sizing is content-box, which means padding and 
          borders are added to the overall box.
