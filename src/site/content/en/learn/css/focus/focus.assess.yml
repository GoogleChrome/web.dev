    stem: Which of the following input devices can set focus?
    options:
      - content: Gamepad
        rationale: "Gamepads often send keyboard events when their buttons are
        pressed."
      - content: Keyboard
        rationale: "Definitely causes focus when used to navigate the web."
      - content: Mouse
        rationale: "A mouse requires vision and no longer puts focus on elements
        when used. All browsers used to put focus on things like buttons when
        clicked, but that has changed."
      - content: Assistive technology (screen reader, switch, etc)
        rationale: "Definitely causes focus when used to navigate the web."
      - content: A potato
        rationale: "Sorry, while a potato can be used as a pointer on touch
        screens, it does not cause focus after interacting with on screen
        inputs."
