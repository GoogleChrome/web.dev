      If two elements stacked on top of each other both have 20px of top margin
      and 30px of bottom margin, how much space will there be between them?
    options:
      - content: "10px"
        rationale: "Try again!"
      - content: "20px"
        rationale: "Not quite"
      - content: "30px"
        rationale: "CSS will take the larger of the margin spaces between
        elements yep!"
      - content: "40px"
        rationale: "Try again!"
