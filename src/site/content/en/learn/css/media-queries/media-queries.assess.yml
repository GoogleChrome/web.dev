      These two media queries are equivalent in functionality

          Correct!
      - content: "False"
        rationale: |
          Yes, [Nesting media queries](https://css-tricks.com/nested-media-queries/). Media queries with a *media condition* only consisting of media features have  `all` as their default media type. Accordingly both queries will work with any medium that is landscape oriented to conditionally style the background of the document blue.
