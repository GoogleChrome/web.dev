    stem: Which of the following are CSS grid terms?
    options:
      - content: "lines"
        rationale: "The grid is divided by these horizontal and vertically
        running separators."
      - content: "circles"
        rationale: "Sorry, no concepts of circles in CSS grid."
      - content: "cells"
        rationale: "A single intersection of a row and a column creates a grid cell."
      - content: "areas"
        rationale: "Multiple cells together."
      - content: "trains"
        rationale: "Sorry, no concepts of trains in CSS grid."
      - content: "gaps"
        rationale: "The space between cells."
      - content: "tracks"
        rationale: "A single row or a column is a track in the grid."

    stem: What is the default layout direction of a grid?
    options:
      - content: Rows
        rationale: "Without any columns defined, grid children lay out in the
        block direction as they normally would."
      - content: Columns
        rationale: "If `grid-auto-flow: column` was present, than a grid would
        layout as columns."

    cardinality: "1"
    correctAnswers: "0"
    stem: What is the difference between `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`?
    options:
      - content: "`auto-fit` will stretch cells to fit the container, where
      `auto-fill` won't."
        rationale: "`auto-fill` places as many items into the template as
        possible, without stretching. Fit **makes** them fit."
      - content: "`auto-fit` will stretch a container to fit the children, where
      `auto-fill` makes the children fit to the container."
        rationale: "This is not how these properties behave."

    correctAnswers: "2"
    stem: What is `min-content`?
    options:
      - content: "Same as 0%"
        rationale: "0% is a relative value of the parent box, while
        `min-content` is relative to the words and images in the box."
      - content: "The smallest letter"
        rationale: "While there is a smallest letter, letters are not what
        `min-content` is refering to."
      - content: "The longest word or image."
        rationale: "In the phrase 'CSS is awesome', the word awesome would be
        the `min-content`."
  - type: multiple-choice
    cardinality: "1"
    correctAnswers: "0"
    stem: What is `max-content`?
    options:
      - content: "The longest sentence or biggest image."
        rationale: "This is the maximum size the content of the box is asking
        for or has specified. It's a sentence at its widest or an image at its
        widest."
      - content: "The longest letter."
        rationale: "While there is a longest letter, letters are not what
        `max-content` is refering to."
      - content: "The longest word."
        rationale: "The longest word is `min-content`."
  - type: multiple-choice
    cardinality: "1"
    correctAnswers: "2"
    stem: What is auto-placement?
    options:
      - content: "When grid takes the child items and places them in the best
      order based on browser heuristics."
        rationale: "No browser will change your content order, only your own
        styles will do that."
      - content: "When grid child items have been given a `grid-area` and are
      placed on that cell."
        rationale: "That's explicit placement not auto placement."
      - content: "When unassigned grid items are placed next in a layout
      template."
        rationale: "Grid items without an explicit area will be placed in the next available grid cell"
