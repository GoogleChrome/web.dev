    stem: If z-index isn't working, what property should you inspect on your element?
    options:
      - content: "`display`"
        rationale: "Not the likely property for why z-index isn't working."
      - content: "`relative`"
        rationale: "This is a CSS value, not a property."
      - content: "`position`"
        rationale: "Make sure this is set to something other than `static`."
      - content: "`animation`"
        rationale: "Not the likely property for why z-index isn't working."

    stem: "Do flexbox and grid need `position: relative`?"
    options:
      - content: "Yes"
        rationale: "These display types do not need it."
      - content: "No"
        rationale: "Using z-index inside a flexbox or grid layout will work
        without `position: relative`."
