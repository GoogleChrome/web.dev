      - content: "`sci-fi`"
        rationale: "Try again. `fantasy` is a valid generic fallback for `font-family`, though."
      - content: "`sans-serif`"
        rationale: "Correct!"
      - content: "`helvetica`"
        rationale: "Try again. `\"Helvetica\"` is not a generic keyword, but instead refers to a specific font family."

    options:
      - content: "True"

      - content: "False"
        rationale: "Correct! [`text-orientation`](#change-the-orientation-of-text) changes the rotation of letters in a line. Use `text-align` to align text to the left, right, or center (and [more!](#change-text-alignment))."

      - content: "`baseline-distance`"
        rationale: "Try again."
      - content: "`line-height`"
        rationale: "Correct!"
