      By default, flex items are aligned to `stretch`. If you want content
      size used for child items, which of the following styles would you use?
    options:
      - content: "`justify-content: flex-start`"
        rationale: "The justify property is for horizontal alignment, not
        vertical."
      - content: "`align-content: start`"
        rationale: "`content` aligns flex lines, not child item alignment."
      - content: "`height: auto`"
        rationale: "This will have no effect."
      - content: "`align-items: flex-start`"
        rationale: "Yes, we want to vertically align them to the 'top' or start,
        which removes the default stretch value and instead uses the content
        height."
