      **Test your knowledge of cascade origins**, consider the following style
      rules from various origins:

      #### User-agent style
      ```css
      h1 { margin-block-start: 0.83em; }
      ```

      #### Bootstrap
      ```css
      h1 { margin-block-start: 20px; }
      ```

      #### Page Author styles
      ```css
      h1 { margin-block-start: 2ch; }

      @media (max-width: 480px) {
        h1 { margin-block-start: 1ch; }
      }
      ```

      #### User custom style
      ```css
      h1 { margin-block-start: 2rem !important; }
      ```

      Then, given the following HTML:
      ```html
      <h1>Lorem ipsum</h1>
      ```
    cardinality: "1"
    correctAnswers: "2"
    stem: "What is the final `margin-block-start` of the `h1`?"
    options:
      - content: 20px
        rationale: "Bootstrap is part of the authored origin, which loses to the
        important local user style"
      - content: 0.83em
        rationale: "The user agent style origin loses to the important local
        user style"
      - content: 2rem
        rationale: "This `!important` user custom style has the most specific
        origin"
      - content: 2ch
        rationale: "This author style is part of the authored origin, which loses to the
        important local user style"
      - content: 1ch
        rationale: "This author style is part of the authored origin, which loses to the
        important local user style"
