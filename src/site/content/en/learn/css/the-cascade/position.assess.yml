      If you have the following HTML on your page:

      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
        </head>
        <body>
          <button>I am a button</button>
          <style>
            button {
              background: pink;
            }
          </style>
        </body>
      </html>
      ```

      Inside `styles.css`, is the following CSS rule:

      ```css
      button {
        background: yellow;
      }
      ```
    cardinality: "1"
    correctAnswers: "0"
    stem: What color is the button's background?
    options:
      - content: pink
        rationale: | 
          The embedded `<style>` origin is further down the page than the
          `<link>` tag, so while the specificity of `button` is the same, the
          **position** of the style rule makes it win.
      - content: yellow
        rationale: | 
          To the HTML document, the yellow button background may have been read
          first, but a newer rule of the same specificity was discovered later,
          making this rule not apply to the button.
