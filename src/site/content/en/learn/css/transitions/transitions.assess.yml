    stem: Which transition property is for specifying easing?
    options:
      - content: "`transition-duration`"
        rationale: "Try again."
      - content: "`transition-easing`"
        rationale: "Not a real CSS property."
      - content: "`transition-cubic-bezier`"
        rationale: "Not a real CSS property."
      - content: "`transition-timing-function`"
        rationale: "Correct!"
      - content: "`animation-ease`"
        rationale: "Not a real CSS property."

    stem: "It's best practice to use `transition-property: all`"
    options:
      - content: "true"
        rationale: "Try again. Specifying `all` can lead to performance issues and unintended transitions."
      - content: "false"
        rationale: "Correct. Best practice is to specify each property individually. Finer control will lead to better performance and more predictable outcomes."

    correctAnswers: "1"
    stem: "All properties can be transitioned."
    options:
      - content: "true"
        rationale: "Try again. Properties like `font-family` cannot transition."
      - content: "false"
        rationale: "Correct. A transition can be specified for incompatible properties, but they will transition discretely."
