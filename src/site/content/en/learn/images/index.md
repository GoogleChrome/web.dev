This course is created for beginner and advanced web developers alike, covering everything from the basics of ensuring image sources are efficiently requested and rendered, to the details of how common image formats are communicated from server to client. Throughout this course you’ll learn how to achieve the smallest possible transfer sizes for your images without compromising on their quality—at least, not in a way anyone will be able to see.

You can go through the series from start to finish for a holistic understanding of how images work on the modern web, or use it as a reference for the specific concepts and markup patterns you’ll be using in your day-to-day work.

For those new to web development, check out the [Learn HTML](/learn/html/) courses for the basics of using markup, [Learn CSS](/learn/css/) courses for styling fundamentals, and [Learn Responsive Design](/learn/design/) courses for an understanding of how images will be rendered in responsive layouts.

Here's what you'll learn:

## [A brief history of images on the web](/learn/images/history/)
A history of images on the web, starting with the image element in 1993

## [Key performance issues](/learn/images//performance-issues/)
Images add a tremendous amount of value, but they come at a cost. Learn ways to ensure that your image requests are as small and performant as possible.

## [Vector images](/learn/images/vector-images/)
Learn the basics of SVG, the vector image format designed for the web.

## [Raster images](/learn/images/raster-images/)
Learn how raster images such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, and WebP are understood by browsers.

## [Image formats: GIF](/learn/images/gif/)
Understand the GIF image format—and the basics of image encodings.

## [Image formats: PNG](/learn/images/png/)
Learn what sets PNG apart from other legacy formats.

## [Image formats: JPEG](/learn/images/jpeg/)
Understand the most common image format on the web.

## [Image formats: WebP](/learn/images/webp/)
Learn how WebP builds on JPEG’s foundational technologies to provide smaller, higher quality image sources.

## [Image formats: AVIF](/learn/images/avif)
Learn about the new AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) and how you can start experimenting with it today.

## [Responsive images](/learn/images/responsive-images/)
A guide to responsive images use cases and the problems they aim to solve.

## [Descriptive syntaxes](/learn/images/descriptive/)
Using `srcset` and `sizes` to provide the browser with the information it needs to request the image that will best fit a user’s browsing context.

## [Prescriptive syntaxes](/learn/images/prescriptive/)
Using the `picture` and `source` elements to deliver image sources based on your specific criteria: viewport size, browser support, and more.

## [Automating compression and encoding](/learn/images/automating)
Make generating highly performant image sources a seamless part of your development process.

## [Site Generators, frameworks, and CMSs](/learn/images/cms/)
Discover how static site generators, development frameworks, and content management systems can help manage everything from encoding and compression to responsive image markup.

## [Image content delivery networks](/learn/images/cdn/)
Learn how image CDNs have the ability to automatically transform and optimize the contents of an image.
