Imagine a world where you couldn't buy a present for a friend because the
online shopping cart was incompatible with your device. Or a world where you
had to ask a co-worker to help you understand the recent sales chart since it
only used soft monotone colors. Maybe, you couldn't enjoy that new show
everyone's been talking about because the captions are missing or badly
automated.

For some people, this world is an everyday reality. But it doesn't always have
to be this wayâ€”this is a reality you can help change when you make digital
accessibility a priority. Digital accessibility, commonly abbreviated
[a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/a11y-and-other-numeronyms/), is about
designing and building digital products so that disabled people can still
interact with that product in a meaningful and equivalent way.

Beyond the typical leadership buy-in, time, effort, and budget that is required
of any project, building digital products with full inclusivity in mind also
requires:

* Expert knowledge of various accessibility standards
* Understanding the fundamentals of accessible designs and code
* Importance of using multiple testing techniques and tools

Most importantly, true inclusivity can only come when you include people with
disabilities and accessibility best practices into the full product
lifecycle&mdash;from planning, to designing, to coding, and more.
