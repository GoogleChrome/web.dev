Imagine a world where you couldn't buy a present for a friend because the
online shopping cart was incompatible with your device. Or a world where you
had to ask a co-worker to help you understand the recent sales chart since it
only used soft monotone colors. Maybe, you couldn't enjoy that new show
everyone's been talking about because the captions are missing or badly
automated.

For some people, this world is an everyday reality. But it doesn't always have
to be this wayâ€”this is a reality you can help change when you make digital
accessibility a priority. Digital accessibility, commonly abbreviated
[a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/a11y-and-other-numeronyms/), is about
designing and building digital products so that disabled people can still
interact with that product in a meaningful and equivalent way.
