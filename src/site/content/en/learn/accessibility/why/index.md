Imagine a world where you couldn't buy a present for a friend because the
online shopping cart was incompatible with your device. Or a world where you
had to ask a co-worker to help you understand the recent sales chart since it
only used soft monotone colors. Maybe, you couldn't enjoy that new show
everyone's been talking about because the captions are missing or badly
automated.

For some people, this world is an everyday reality. But it doesn't always have
to be this way&mdash;this is a reality you can help change when you make digital
accessibility a priority. Digital accessibility, commonly abbreviated
[a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/a11y-and-other-numeronyms/), is about
designing and building digital products so that disabled people can still
interact with that product in a meaningful and equivalent way.

Beyond the typical leadership buy-in, time, effort, and budget that is required
of any project, building digital products with full inclusivity in mind also
requires:

* Expert knowledge of various accessibility standards
* Understanding the fundamentals of accessible designs and code
* Importance of using multiple testing techniques and tools

Most importantly, true inclusivity can only come when you include people with
disabilities and accessibility best practices into the full product
lifecycle&mdash;from planning, to designing, to coding, and more.

## What is the individual impact?

The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/sensory-functions-disability-and-rehabilitation/world-report-on-disability)
(WHO) estimates that over 15% of the world's population&mdash;or 1.3 billion
people&mdash;self-identify as having a disability making this group the largest
minority group globally. More recent reports from the
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html),
the [U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p70-152.pdf),
the [Academic Network of European Disability Experts (ANED)](https://includ-ed.eu/sites/default/files/documents/aned_2013_task_6_-_comparative_data_synthesis_report_-_europe2020_final.pdf),
and others estimate the total number of people with disabilities to be even
greater. This continues to grow as the world population ages and faces chronic
health conditions.

Inaccessible digital products impact people with disabilities. Some types of
disabilities are impacted more in the digital world than others. Examples
include people with:

Visual impairments
{% endDetailsSummary %}

[Visual impairment](https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/vision/) (vision impairment, vision disability) is a decreased ability to see to the degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses or medication. Visual impairment can be due to disease, trauma, or congenital or degenerative conditions.

</figure>

* _Examples_: B/blindness, low vision, color blindness
* _Prevalence_: 253 million people with visual impairment worldwide—36 million were blind, 217 million had moderate to severe visual impairment (MSVI) ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5820628/)), and 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women are colorblind. ([Source](https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/))
* _Tools_: screen reader software, screen magnification tools, Braille output devices.
* _Pain points_: ​Digital products that do not work with screen reader software, mobile websites/apps without pinch to zoom, complex graphs and charts differentiated by colors alone, color contrasts that make it difficult to read text on the screen

Hearing impairments
{% endDetailsSummary %}

A [hearing impairment or hearing loss](https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/hearing/) is a full or partial decrease in the ability to detect or understand sounds. Hearing impairments are caused by a wide range of biological and environmental factors.

* _Examples_: D/deafness, hard of hearing (HoH), hearing impaired (HI)
* _Prevalence_: 66 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss ([Source](https://www.who.int/health-topics/hearing-loss#tab=tab_1))
