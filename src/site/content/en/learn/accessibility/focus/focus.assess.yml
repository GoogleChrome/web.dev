    stem: 'Which example of `:focus` CSS style is the most accessible on a white background?'
    options:
      - content: '`outline: 0.5rem solid yellow;`'
        rationale: "This would not meet WCAG's color contrast guidelines."
      - content: '`background-color:black;`'
        rationale: "While it's possible this may be accessible, this design requires additional consideration of text color and placement in the document."
      - content: '`text-decoration: dotted underline 2px blue;`'
        rationale: "This design is the most accessible option on this list. However, this is not the only accessible design choice. Remember that your design should adhere to the 3:1 color contrast ratio as set by WCAG."
      - content: '`outline: none; text-decoration:none; background:none;`'
        rationale: "A visual indicator is important for some keyboard users. Always include style for focus."

    stem: What's the purpose of a skip link?
    options:
      - content: "Help keyboard users skip over redundant or unuseful groups of links."
        rationale: "This is especially helpful in long navigation menus, when a user may have already gone to the page of interest."
      - content: "Help keyboard users skip over uninteresting content."
        rationale: "It's not necessarily possible to know what content is or isn't interesting to any user. This is not a useful way of defining skip link usage."
