    correctAnswers: "1"
    stem: 'On which elements should you add `tabindex="0"`'
    options:
      - content: "All HTML elements."
        rationale: 'Naturally focusable elements are already included in focus order, so it is unnecessary and potentially disruptive to add additional `tabindex`.'
      - content: 'A non-interactive element that has CSS `overflow` applied to it.'
        rationale: 'This will allow keyboard users to navigate to and move around overflow content. Learn more about [tabindex and scrollable overflow containers](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-use-the-tabindex-attribute/#scrollable-overflow-containers).'
      - content: "A non-interactive element nested within an interactive element."
        rationale: 'If the parent element is interactive, adding `tabindex` to the child element may cause confusion.'

    stem: What's the purpose of a skip link?
    options:
      - content: "Help keyboard users skip over redundant or unuseful groups of links."
        rationale: "This is especially helpful in long navigation menus, when a user may have already gone to the page of interest."
      - content: "Help keyboard users skip over uninteresting content."
        rationale: "It's not necessarily possible to know what content is or isn't interesting to any user. This is not a useful way of defining skip link usage."
