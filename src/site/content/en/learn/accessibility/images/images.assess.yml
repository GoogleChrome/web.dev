    stem: How can you make complex images accessible?
    options:
      - content: "Include an explanation later in the article."
        rationale: "Not quite. This can be helpful, but only when used with a link to the longer description."
      - content: "Use a link for longer explanations."
        rationale: "This method is a good choice for anyone who might benefit from having this additional image information readily available on the screen, instead of buried in the code."
      - content: 'Add the `aria-describedby` attribute to the image.'
        rationale: "This method creates a strong association between the image and the full description."
      - content: "Add longform alt text with a full description."
        rationale: "Avoid using alt text in this instance, as it wonâ€™t be available to users without AT and may not be read in-full."
