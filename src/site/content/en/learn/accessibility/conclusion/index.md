Congratulations, you've made it through Learn Accessibility! At this point,
you've learned a lot of best practices for accessibility and gone through
multiple rounds of accessibility testing. You may have learned some new
terminology or refreshed your memory in our
[glossary](/learn/accessibility/glossary/).

We hope you are confident applying these lessons to your websites and web
applications.
