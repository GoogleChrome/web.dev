Have you ever been riding in a car, boat, or plane and suddenly felt the world
spin? Or had a migraine so bad that animations on your phone or tablet, 
created to “delight” you, suddenly make you sick? Or perhaps you've always been
sensitive to all types of motion? These are examples of different types of
vestibular disorders. 

By age 40, over 35% of adults will have experienced some form of
[vestibular dysfunction](https://vestibular.org/article/what-is-vestibular/about-vestibular-disorders/).
This may lead to a temporary dizzy spell, migraine-induced vertigo, or a more
permanent vestibular disability.

Beyond triggering vertigo, many people find moving, blinking, or scrolling
content distracting. People with
[ADHD](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-teens-what-you-need-to-know)
and other attention deficit disorders might be so distracted by your animated
elements that they forget why they even went to your website or app in the
first place.

In this module, we’ll look at some of the ways to help better support people
with all types of movement-triggered disorders.
