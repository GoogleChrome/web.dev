    stem: Your site is a multi-language online textbook, where multiple languages are shown on one page. What's the best way to tell assistive technology the language of the copy?
    options:
      - content: "Don't worry about it, the AT can automatically read each language."
        rationale: "While some AT may have language detection skills, you can't guarantee the AT will guess correctly."
      - content: 'Include all languages in the `<html>` element.'
        rationale: 'The `lang` attribute can only have one language associated with it.'
      - content: 'Set `lang` on each element.'
        rationale: 'The AT will primarily rely on the `<html>` attribute to read the document, unless an element is explicitly labeled with a different `lang`. For multi-language text, make sure to add a `lang` attribute around the language which differs from the main HTML document.'
