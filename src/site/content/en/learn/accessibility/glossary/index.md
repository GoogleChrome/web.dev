is the final report presented to a client once a full ACT has been performed.
If you need a legally binding version of the ACR, you would utilize a version

## Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) {: #act}

[ACT](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/) is commonly referred to
as an accessibility audit. The ACT utilizes various testing methodology and
tools: primarily automated, manual, and assistive technology (AT) devices. The
ACT is first performed as a baseline metric to gauge general accessibility
compliance of a digital product. It's often run multiple times throughout the
software product lifecycle to check for changes in the level of conformance
against a set of pre-determined accessibility checkpoints or guidelines.
