      - content: "Use Javascript to apply dynamic style directly within an HTML element."

      - content: "Use JavaScript to toggle an element’s class, and add the style to your CSS stylesheet."
        rationale: "Correct. Keep your style in the CSS stylesheet and use lightweight JavaScript to change the class name."

    stem: Can all JavaScript actions support keyboard users?
    options:
      - content: "Yes, but you may have to do some extra work."
        rationale: "Correct. Semantic HTML supports keyboard users by default, but non-semantic elements with actions need additional JavaScript."
      - content: "Yes, all actions automatically support keyboard users."
        rationale: "Incorrect. Only semantic HTML automatically supports keyboard focus."
      - content: "No, you can only support keyboard users with semantic HTML."
        rationale: "Incorrect. All HTML elements can support keyboard users."
