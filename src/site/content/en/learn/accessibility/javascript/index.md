In development today, JavaScript plays a major role in almost everything we
createâ€”from smaller dynamic components to full products running on a JavaScript
framework, such as React or Angular.

This use (or overuse) of JavaScript has brought forward many alarming trends,
such as long load times due to large amounts of code, use of non-semantic HTML
elements, and injection of HTML and CSS through JavaScript. And you may be
unsure of how accessibility fits into each of these pieces.

JavaScript can have a huge impact on the accessibility of your site. In this
module, we'll share some general patterns for accessibility that are enhanced
by JavaScript, as well as solutions for accessibility issues that arise from
using JavaScript frameworks.

## Trigger events

JavaScript events allow users to interact with web content and perform a
specific action. Many people, such as screen reader users,
people with fine-motor skill disabilities, people without a mouse or trackpad,
and others, rely on keyboard support to interact with the web.
It's critical that you add keyboard support to your JavaScript actions, as it
affects all of these users.

Let's look at a [click event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event).
If an `onClick()` event is used on a semantic HTML element such as a `<button>`
or `<a>`, it naturally includes both mouse and keyboard functionality. However,
keyboard functionality is not automatically applied when an `onClick()` event
is added to a non-semantic element, such as a generic `<div>`.

<div class="switcher">
{% Compare 'worse' %}
```html
<div role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="doAction()">Click me!</div>
```
{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better' %}
```html
<button onclick="doAction()">Click me!</div>
```
{% endCompare %}
</div>

Preview this comparison [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/bGKOrLj).

If a non-semantic element is used for a trigger event, a
[keydown/keyup event](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/button/button.html)
must be added to detect the enter or space key press. Adding trigger events to
non-semantic elements is often forgotten. Unfortunately, when it's forgotten,
the result is a component that's only accessible via a mouse. Keyboard-only
users are left without access to the associated actions.

## Page titles

As we learned in the [Document module](/accessibility/more-html/),
the page title is essential for screen reader users. It tells users what page
they are on and whether they have navigated to a new page.

If you use a JavaScript framework, you need to consider how you handle page
titles. This is especially important for
[single-page apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SPA) (SPAs)
that load from a singular `index.html` file, as transitions or routes (page
changes) will not involve a page reload. Each time a user loads a new page in
an SPA, the title won't change by default.

For SPAs, the [document.title](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/title)
value can be added manually or with a helper package (depending on the
JavaScript framework). Announcing the
[updated page titles](https://hidde.blog/accessible-page-titles-in-a-single-page-app/)
to a screen reader user may take some additional work, but the good news is
you've got options, such as dynamic content.

## Dynamic content

One of the most powerful JavaScript functionalities is the ability to add HTML
and CSS to any element on the page. Developers can create dynamic applications
based on the actions or behaviors of the users.

Let's say you need to send a message to users when they log in to your website
or app. You want the message to stand out from the white background and relay
the message: "You are now logged in."

You can use the element [`innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML)
to set the content:

```javascript
document.querySelector("#banner").innerHTML = '<p>You are now logged in</p>';
```

You can apply CSS in a similar way, with
[`setAttribute`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute):

```javascript
document.querySelector("#banner").setAttribute("style", "border-color:#0000ff;");
```

With great power comes great responsibility. Unfortunately, JavaScript
injection of HTML and CSS has historically been misused to create inaccessible
content. Some common misuses are listed here:

<div class="table-wrapper with-heading-tint">
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Possible misuse</th>
    <th>Correct use</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Render large chunks of non-semantic HTML</td>
    <td>Render smaller pieces of semantic HTML</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not allowing time for dynamic content to be recognized by assistive technology</td>
    <td>Using a <code>setTimeout()</code> time delay to allow users to hear the full message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Applying style attributes for <code>onFocus()</code> dynamically</td>
    <td>Use <code>:focus</code> for the related elements in your CSS stylesheet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Applying inline styles may cause user stylesheets to not be read properly</td>
    <td>Keep your styles in CSS files to keep the consistency of the theme</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Creating very large JavaScript files that slow down overall site performance</td>
    <td>Use less JavaScript. You may be able to perform similar functions in CSS (such as animations or sticky navigation), which parse faster and are more performant</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

For CSS, toggle CSS classes instead adding inline styles, as this
allows for reusability and simplicity. Use hidden content on the page and
toggle classes to hide and show content for dynamic HTML. If you need to use
JavaScript to dynamically add content to your page, ensure it's simple and
concise, and of course, accessible.

## Focus management

In the [Keyboard focus module](/accessibility/focus), we covered focus order
and indicator styles. Focus management is knowing when and where to trap the
focus and when it shouldn't be trapped. Focus management is critical for
keyboard-only users.

### Component level

You can create keyboard traps when a component's focus is not properly managed.
A keyboard trap occurs when a keyboard-only user gets stuck in a component, or
the focus is not maintained when it should be.

One of the most common patterns where users experience focus management issues
is in a modal component. When a keyboard-only user encounters a modal, the user
should be able to tab between the actionable elements of the modal, but they
should never be allowed outside of the modal without explicitly dismissing it.
JavaScript is essential to properly trapping this focus.

{% Compare 'worse' %}

{% Codepen {
 user: 'web-dev-codepen-external',
 id: 'ZERVJMz',
 height: 350,
 theme: 'auto',
 tab: 'js,result'
} %}

{% endCompare %}

{% Compare 'better' %}

{% Codepen {
 user: 'web-dev-codepen-external',
 id: 'zYaydmv',
 height: 350,
 theme: 'auto',
 tab: 'js,result'
} %}

{% endCompare %}

### Page level

Focus must also be maintained when a user navigates from page-to-page. This is
especially true in SPAs, where there is [no browser refresh](https://marcysutton.com/prototype-testing-accessible-clientside-routing/),
and all content dynamically changes. Anytime a user clicks on a link to go
to another page within your application, the focus is either kept in the same
place or potentially placed somewhere else entirely.

When transitioning between pages (or routing), the development team must decide
where the focus goes when the page loads.

There are multiple techniques to achieve this:

* Place focus on the main container with an `aria-live` announcement.
* Put the focus back to a link to skip to the main content.
* Move the focus to the top-level heading of the new page.

Where you decide to put the focus will depend on the framework you are using
and the content you want to serve up to your users. It may be context- or
action-dependent.

## State management

Another area where JavaScript is critical to accessibility is state management,
or when a component or page's current visual state is relayed to a low-vision, blind, or deafblind assistive technology user.

Often, the state of a component or page is managed through ARIA attributes, as
introduced in the [ARIA and HTML module](/learn/accessibility/aria-html/).
Let's review a few of the most common types of ARIA attributes used to help
manage the state of an element.

### Component level

Depending on your page content and what information your users need, there are
many [ARIA states](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes)
to consider when relaying information about a component to the user.

For example, you may use an
[`aria-expanded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-expanded)
attribute to tell the user whether a drop-down menu or list is expanded or
collapsed.

{% Codepen {
 user: 'web-dev-codepen-external',
 id: 'oNyJeQZ',
 height: 300,
 theme: 'auto',
 tab: 'html,result'
} %}

Or you might use [`aria-pressed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-pressed)
to indicate that a button has been pressed.

{% Codepen {
 user: 'web-dev-codepen-external',
 id: 'jOKXLyv',
 height: 300,
 theme: 'auto',
 tab: 'html,result'
} %}

It's important to be selective when applying ARIA attributes. Think through the
user flow to understand what critical information should be conveyed to the user.

### Page level

Developers often use a visually hidden area called the
[ARIA live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)
to announce changes on the screen and alert messages to assistive technology
(AT) users. This area can be paired with JavaScript to notify users of dynamic
changes to the page without requiring the entire page to reload.

{% Codepen {
 user: 'web-dev-codepen-external',
 id: 'Yzvdxdr',
 height: 450,
 theme: 'auto',
 tab: 'result'
} %}

Historically, JavaScript has struggled to announce content in
[`aria-live`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live)
and alert regions due to its dynamic nature. Asynchronously adding content into
the DOM makes it hard for AT to pick up the region and announce it.
For the content to be properly read, the live or alert region must be in the
DOM on load, then the text can dynamically be swapped out.

If you use a JavaScript framework, the good news is almost all of them have a
"live announcer" package that does all the work for you and is fully
accessible. There is no need to worry about creating a live region and dealing
with the issues described in the previous section.

Here are some live packages for common JavaScript frameworks:

* React: [react-aria-live](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-aria-live) and 
  [react-a11y-announcer](https://github.com/thinkcompany/react-a11y-announcer)
* Angular: [`LiveAnnouncer`](https://material.angular.io/cdk/a11y/overview#liveannouncer)
* Vue: [vue-a11y-utils](https://jinjiang.dev/vue-a11y-utils/#vuelive-component)

Modern JavaScript is a powerful language that allows web developers to create
robust web applications. This sometimes leads to over-engineering and, by
extension, inaccessible patterns. By following the JavaScript patterns and tips
in this module, you can make your apps more accessible to all users.
