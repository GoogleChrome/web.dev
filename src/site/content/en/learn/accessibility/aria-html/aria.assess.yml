    stem: Which of the following is the best practice for building an accessible button?
    options:
      - content: '`<div id="saveChanges" aria-role="button" aria-pressed="false" tabindex="0">Go to shop</div>`'
        rationale: "Not quite. ARIA shouldn't be used when a semantic HTML element is available."
      - content: '`<a id="saveChanges" aria-label="Some awesome article title">Go to shop</a>`'
        rationale: "Not quite. While you could style this link like a button with CSS, it's not the best practice."
      - content: '`<button id="saveChanges" type="button">Go to shop</button>`'
        rationale: "Great job! Use the correct semantic HTML as well as the type to create a button."
