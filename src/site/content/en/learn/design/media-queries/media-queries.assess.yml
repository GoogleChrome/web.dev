    options:
      - content: "`@media (width: 720px)`"
        rationale: "Try again! This media query is only when the browser window is equal to `720px`."
      - content: "`@media (max-width: 720px)`"

      - content: "`@media (min-width: 720px)`"
        rationale: "🎉 You can read this as the browser window is at least `720px`."
      - content: "`@media (clamp-width: 720px)`"
        rationale: "Try again! `clamp-width` is not a valid media query feature condition."
