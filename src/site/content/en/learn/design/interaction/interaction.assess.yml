    options:
      - content: "CSS media features"

      What is the difference between `@media (pointer)` and `@media (any-pointer)`?
    options:
      - content: "Any pointer includes things like your finger as a pointer."
        rationale: "Pointer already includes touch as an input type."
      - content: "Pointers don't include things like a mouse."
        rationale: "Pointers do include a mouse as an input device."
      - content: "Any pointer will report true when additional, none primary inputs, like a stylus, pass the test."
        rationale: "`any-pointer` queries all device input types for any match."
