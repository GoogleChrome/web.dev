    stem: "To provide theme colors that impact the browser outside of the webpage, use:"
    options:
      - content: "CSS"

      - content: "A web app manifest"
        rationale: "`manifest.json` can be provided and includes fields for specifying theme colors for tinting how the app looks being opened from a mobile homescreen."
      - content: "A 'theme-color' `<meta>` tag"
        rationale: "As soon as possible a browser can notice this theme color in the `<head>` tag, avoiding unwanted flashes of color."

    stem: "So you support dark theme, but all the form inputs are still light themed. What can you do?"
    options:
      - content: "Add `html { color-scheme: light dark; }` to your CSS."
        rationale: "This signals from CSS that the form inputs should match the system color scheme."
      - content: 'Add `<meta name="supported-color-schemes" content="light dark">` to your HTML `<head>` tag.'
        rationale: "This signals from HTML that the form inputs should match the system color scheme."
      - content: "Write a bunch of CSS to change all the defaults of the input."
        rationale: "This works too, but is a bit harder."
