      This HTML renders a modal dialog:

      ```html
      <div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-header">
        <button aria-label="Close"></button>
        <h2 id="dialog-header">
          Do you want to allow notifications from this website?
        </h2>
        <button>No</button>
        <button>Yes</button>
      </div>
      ```

          1. The **Close** button
          1. The **No** button
          1. The **Yes** button

          Only the `<button>` elements are included in the tab order
          because they're the only standardized HTML form elements.
          To insert other elements into the tab order, you would add a `tabindex` attribute.

      <section tabindex="-1">
        <h2>Cat facts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A group of cats is called a <a href="https://m-w.com/dictionary/clowder">clowder</a>.</li>
          <li>Most cats are <a href="https://www.catfacts.org/catnip.html"> unaffected by catnip</a>.</li>

    stem: Which elements from the sample are included in the tab order?

      - rationale: |
          Only the `<a>` elements are included in the tab order.

          The `<section>` element is not in the tab order
          because it has a negative `tabindex` value.
          (It can, however, be focused using the `focus()` method.)
          The `tabindex` value for the `<section>` element doesn't affect its children.
