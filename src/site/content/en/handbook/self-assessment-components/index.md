Self-assessments provide opportunities for users
to check their understanding of concepts covered in your post.

## Start a self-assessment

To include a self-assessment in your post:
1. Add this short code to your post where you want the self-assessment to appear:
    ```html
    {% raw %}{% Assessment page, 'my-first-self-assessment' %}{% endraw %}
    ```
1. Copy `my-first-self-assessment.assess.yml` in `src/site/_drafts/_template-self-assessment`
   to your post's directory.
1. Change the file's name to match
   the topic of your assessment: `your-assessment-topic.assess.yml`.
1. Update the argument in the short code to match the new file name.
1. Using the YAML template as a starting point,
   follow the instructions below to create your question set.

## Question set parameters

### Set leader

When a self-assessment includes more than one question,
add a **set leader**â€”a statement about what the question set
as a whole coversâ€”using the `setLeader` key. For example:

```yaml
setLeader: Test your knowledge of resource optimization
```

You can omit the `setLeader` if there's only one question in the set.
(One-question sets will ignore a `setLeader` if you accidentally include one.)

{% Aside %}
On mobile, the set leader appears on its own with an **Open quiz** button
that launches the self-assessment set in a modal,
so make sure the set leader makes sense whether or not the questions are visible.
{% endAside %}

### Height

Self-assessments have a default question content height of 400&nbsp;px.
(A stable height keeps the location of the **Check** / **Next** button predictable.)

If most of your questions are taller or shorter than the default height,
change it using the `height` key.

If you want each question's height to match its content, set `height` to `unset`.
(Note that this will cause the self-assessment height to change
as users check their responses and navigate across questions.)

### Question labels

You can adjust the labels for the question tabs using the `tabLabel` key.
There are three options:
- `question` (default): creates the label `Question n`,
  where _n_ is the number of the tab in the set.
  Use for sets that mostly ask users to submit a response.
- `sample`: creates the label `Sample n`.
  Use for sets that mostly ask users to evaluate code samples.
- `bare`: creates the label `n`
  Use for larger sets where horizontal space is limited.

## Question anatomy and parameters
A self-assessment question includes four components:
- An optional **stimulus** that appears at the top of the question
  and provides any information needed to respond to the question.
  Stimuli may be text, media, or a combination.
  Only one stimulus per question is allowed.
- One or more **stems**, which are the questions or tasks
  the user is being asked to respond to.
  Stems are text only, but they do support inline MarkDown.
- A [response type](#response-types) for each stem,
  which includes several options to choose from
  and accompanying rationales. Rationales are initially hidden.
- An automatically generated question footer,
  which includes the **Check** and **Report issue** buttons.

Once the user submits an answer to a question,
the question shows:
- Whether the option is correct or incorrect
- The rationale for the option

### Cardinality

Use the `cardinality` key to control how many options a user may select:
- `n`: The user must select **exactly _n_** options
  before the response is considered complete.
  If _n_&nbsp;>&nbsp;1, all unselected options will be disabled
  when _n_ options are selected.
- `n+`: The user must select **_n_ or more** options
  before the response is considered complete.
- `nâ€“m`: The user must select at **least _n_ and at most _m_** options
  before the response is considered complete.
  All unselected options will be disabled when _m_ options are selected.

For example,
- `cardinality: "1"` allows users to select only one option.
- `cardinality: "2+"` allows users to select two or more options.
- `cardinality: "2-3"` requires users to select two options
  before allowing them to check their answer
  and doesn't allow them to select more than three options.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
Put quotes around `cardinality` values
so YAML doesn't incorrectly interpret them as numbers.
{% endAside %}

### Correct answer(s)

Use the `correctAnswers` key to indicate all correct answers to a question
using a comma-separated, zero-indexed list.
For example, `correctAnswers: "0,3"` indicates
that the first and fourth answers are correct.

{% Aside 'gotchas' %}
Put quotes around `correctAnswers` values
so YAML doesn't incorrectly interpret them as numbers.
{% endAside %}

### Layout

The options of most [response types](#response-types) can be presented in two columns
by setting the `columns` key to `true`.
(Response types that don't support a two-column layout
will ignore the `columns` key.)

{% Aside %}
It's almost always best to use a single column for textual options.
For image options,
see which layout best balances legibility and screen real estate.
{% endAside %}

## Response types

### Multiple-choice
The multiple-choice response type lets users respond to a question
by selecting from an array of options,
which can include MarkDown or images.
(But not both! Overstuffing your options can make them artificially hard.)

{% Aside 'warning' %}
To help ensure that users understand what selecting an option will do,
don't include links or any other interactive elements in a multiple-choice option.
{% endAside %}

### Think-and-checks
Think-and-checks let you present a stimulus of some kind
(for example, a code sample) and ask a question about it.
Users can formulate a mental response and then check it.

Since think-and-checks don't have any options to submit,
there's no need to provide `cardinality` or `correctAnswers` keys.

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Since think-and-checks don't provide a way for users to select
and validate an actual response,
it's generally better to use any other [response type](#response-types) instead.
{% endAside %}

### Composite questions
You can include more than one response component in a single question.

To do that, add a `components` key to the question object
and then include all question data _except_ the stimulus in each component object.
(Each question can have only one stimulus.)

Here's an example:
```yaml
- stimulus: "![Webby](./webby.png)"
  components:
    - type: multiple-choice
      cardinality: "1"
      correctAnswers: "1"
      stem: Who's this Webby I've heard so much about?
      options:
        - content: A sentient system icon run amok
          rationale: Like this helpful little being would ever go amok.
        - content: The best darn mascot you could hope for
          rationale: Webby is _everything_.
        - content: Spiderman's lesser known sidekick
          rationale: |
            I really don't see Webby swinging around
            on those small (but _adorable_) arms.
    - type: multiple-choice
      cardinality: "1"
      correctAnswers: "2"
      stem: How awesome is Webby?
      options:
        - content: Pretty awesome
          rationale: Nope.
        - content: The awesomest
          rationale: Close but no.
        - content: OMG ðŸ¤¯
          rationale: It was always you, Webby.
```

{% Aside 'caution' %}
Use composite questions judiciously.
The more response components there are, the harder the question is.
It's better to break up a multi-part question into separate questions
unless the parts are truly interdependent.
{% endAside %}

## Multiple sets in one post
To include another set in your post,
create a second `*.assess.yml` file and
add a second `Assessment` short code to your post.
You can add as many assessments as you want as long as each has a unique name.
For example:

```html
{% raw %}{% Assessment page, 'first-assessment' %}
{% Assessment page, 'second-assessment' %}{% endraw %}
```
