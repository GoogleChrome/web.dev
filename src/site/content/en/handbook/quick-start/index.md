  The basic steps to create and publish content on web.dev.
---

Content creation for web.dev has three phases: planning, writing, and publishing.

## Planning
1. Start a content proposal issue on GitHub using [this issue template](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=content+proposal&template=content_proposal.md&title=content%3A+%3CAdd+your+title%3E). The checklist in your issue will guide you through the rest of the process.
1. Create a copy of [this document template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgaNIEnXZf-RB8_p9RK22QEgpXJqnu77pLWVWVy4nuw/edit?usp=sharing) to briefly write up your content idea. Put the link to your doc in your GitHub issue.
1. The web.dev team will take a look to see if the idea fits with the [goals of the site](/about). If the idea is approved, it gets slated for a publication date!

{% Aside 'caution' %}
If the piece you'd like to publish is time sensitive, make sure to submit the issue at least two weeks before the target publication date so there's enough time to move it through the writing process.

## Writing
1. Write a draft in the Google doc you used to propose your piece. (Before you start, read our [style guidelines](/handbook/style).)
1. When you're ready, request a content review in the GitHub issue.
1. The tech writer will review using the [web.dev content checklist](/handbook/content-checklist) and work with you to polish the piece.

## Publishing
1. Once you and the tech writer think the piece is good to go, submit a pull request on GitHub with your content authored in Markdown. (Check out the [web.dev markup](/handbook/#web.dev-markup) section for details.)
1. The web.dev team will give your Markdown a once over. If everything looks good, your pull request is merged, and your piece is published! ðŸŽ‰
