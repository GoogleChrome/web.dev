## Posts
**Format:** primarily informational with instructions included as appropriate

**Typical use cases:**
* A description of a problem detected by a Lighthouse audit and an explanation of how to fix it
* An explanation of how to accomplish a widely applicable web development task—or an explanation of why that task is important
* An explanation of a web development issue relevant to a specific industry (e.g., e-commerce)
* An explanation of how or when to use a common framework (e.g., React, Vue)
* A news announcement relevant to the web.dev audience (e.g., a new API, a recent conference talk)

**Placement on the site:**
* Always appears on the [blog](/blog), organized chronologically
* May transition into a collection in the [Learn](/learn) section, organized thematically with other posts

**Length:** typically less than 1,000–1,500 words

**[Template](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/tree/master/src/site/_drafts/_template-post)**

**Examples:**
* [Are long JavaScript tasks delaying your Time to Interactive?](/long-tasks-devtools)
* [Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense](/code-splitting-suspense)

## Codelabs
**Format:** Multi-step instructions paired with an embedded [sample app](/handbook/markup-sample-app)

**Typical use case:** showing how to do small, fairly discrete development tasks

**Placement on the site:** always associated with a post, which serves as the landing page for the codelab

**Length:** typically less than 1,000–1,500 words

**[Template](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/tree/master/src/site/_drafts/_template-codelab)**

**Examples:**
* Creating WebP images with the command line
* Minify and compress network payloads with gzip
