  Guidance for third-party contributors to web.dev.
---

First, thanks for contributing to web.dev! We really appreciate your help in making this community better.

If you're not a Googler, we ask that you provide a point of contact who can respond to GitHub issues related to your content.  Ideally, your point of contact will be able to respond within a week of when the issue is submitted. The web.dev team will tag the point of contact in relevant issues so that they can respond.
