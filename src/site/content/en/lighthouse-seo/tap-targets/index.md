Tap targets are the areas of a web page that users on touch devices can
interact with. Buttons, links, and form elements all have tap targets.

Many search engines rank pages based on how mobile-friendly they are. Making
sure tap targets are big enough and far enough apart from each other makes
your page more mobile-friendly and accessible.

## How the Lighthouse tap targets audit fails

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) flags pages
with tap targets that are too small or too close together:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="tap-targets.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing inappropriately sized tap targets">
</figure>

Targets that are smaller than 48&nbsp;px by 48&nbsp;px or closer than 8&nbsp;px
apart fail the audit. When the audit fails, Lighthouse lists the results in a
table with three columns:

<div class="w-table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Tap Target</strong></td>
        <td>The tap target that is inappropriately sized.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Size</strong></td>
        <td>The size of the target's bounding rectangle in pixels.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Overlapping Target</strong></td>
        <td>Which other tap targets, if any, are too close.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## How to fix your tap targets

**Step 1:** Increase the size of tap targets that are too small.
Tap targets that are 48&nbsp;px by 48&nbsp;px never fail the audit. If you have
elements that shouldn't _appear_ any bigger (for example, icons), try increasing
the `padding` property:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot" src="touch-target.jpg" alt="Appropriately-sized tap targets">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Use <code>padding</code> to make tap targets bigger without changing the appearance of an element.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Step 2:** Increase the spacing between tap targets that are too close together
using properties like `margin`. There should be at least 8&nbsp;px between
tap targets.
