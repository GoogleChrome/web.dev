  Learn about the the "Document Does Not Have A Meta Description" Lighthouse audit.
web_lighthouse:
  - meta-description
---

Meta descriptions introduce users to your site's content in search results.
High-quality, unique descriptions make your results more relevant
and can increase your search traffic.
Lighthouse flags your page when it's missing a meta description:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="meta-description.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing the document doesn't have a meta description">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” Document doesn't have a meta description
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## What causes this audit to fail

This audit fails if your page doesn't have a description,
or if the `content` attribute of the description is empty.
Lighthouse doesn't evaluate the quality of your description.

{% include 'content/lighthouse-seo/scoring.njk' %}

## How to add a meta description

Add a description tag to the `<head>` of each of your pages:

```html
<meta name="Description" content="Put your description here.">
```

Include clearly-tagged facts in the descriptions, for example:

```html
<meta name="Description" content="Author: A.N. Author, 
    Illustrator: P. Picture, Category: Books, Price: $17.99, 
    Length: 784 pages>
```

## Meta description guidelines

- Make them descriptive and concise. 
- Avoid [keyword stuffing](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66358). 
- Create a description for every page.
- Avoid repeated or boilerplate titles.
- Use different descriptions for different pages.
- Descriptions don't have to be in sentence format; they can contain structured data.

See [Create good meta descriptions](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624#1) for more guidance.
