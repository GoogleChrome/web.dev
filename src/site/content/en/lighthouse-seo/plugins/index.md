Plugins harm SEO. Search engines can't index plugin content.
Many mobile devices don't support plugins,
which creates frustrating experiences for mobile users.
Lighthouse flags your document when it uses plugins:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="plugins.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing document uses plugins">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” Document uses plugins
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## What causes this audit to fail

Lighthouse checks the page for tags that commonly represent plugins:

- `embed`
- `object`
- `applet`

And then flags each tag as a plugin if its MIME type matches any of the following:

- `application/x-java-applet`
- `application/x-java-bean`
- `application/x-shockwave-flash`
- `application/x-silverlight`
- `application/x-silverlight-2`

Or if the tag points to a URL with a file format that is known to represent plugin content:

- `swf`
- `flv`
- `class`
- `xap`

## Remove plugins

Remove the plugins from your document and convert your content to HTML.
Refer to specific documentation for the plugin,
for example, [how to switch Flash video to HTML5 video](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plugins/Flash_to_HTML5/Video).
