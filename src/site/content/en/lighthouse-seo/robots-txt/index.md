The `robots.txt` file tells search engines
what pages of your site they can crawl.
An invalid `robots.txt` configuration can cause
2 general types of problems:

- Not crawling public pages, causing your relevant content
to show up less in search results.
- Crawling private pages,
exposing private information in search results.

Lighthouse flags invalid `robots.txt` files:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="robots-txt.png" alt="Lighthouse audit showing invalid robots.txt">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” <code>robots.txt</code> isn't valid
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## What causes this audit to fail

Expand the **robots.txt is not valid** audit in your report
to learn why your `robots.txt` file is invalid.

Common errors include:

- `No user-agent specified`
- `Pattern should either be empty, start with "/" or "*"` 
- `Unknown directive`
- `Invalid sitemap URL`
- `"$" should only be used at the end of the pattern` 

Most Lighthouse audits only apply to the page that you're currently on.
However, since `robots.txt` is defined at the domain level,
this audit applies to your entire domain (or subdomain). 

{% Aside 'note' %}
Lighthouse does not ensure that your `robots.txt` file is
in the correct location.
{% endAside %}

## How to fix the errors in `robots.txt`

- Make sure the `robots.txt` doesn't return `HTTP 50X`.
- Make sure the `robots.txt` file is smaller than 500 KB.
- Review the format.
- Make sure there are no `allow` or `disallow` directives before `user-agent`.
- Make sure there's a value for `user-agent`.
- Provide an absolute URL for `sitemap` with http/https/ftp scheme.
