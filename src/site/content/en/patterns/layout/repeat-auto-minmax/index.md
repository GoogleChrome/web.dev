For this seventh example, combine some of the concepts you've already learned about to create a responsive layout with automatically-placed and flexible children. Pretty neat. The key terms to remember here are `repeat`, `auto-(fit|fill)`, and `minmax()`, which you remember by the acronym RAM.

All together, it looks like:

```css/2
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr));
}
```

You are using `repeat()` again, but this time, using the `auto-fit` keyword instead of an explicit numeric value. This enables auto-placement of these child elements. These children have a base minimum value of `150px` with a maximum value `1fr`, meaning on smaller screens, they will take up the full `1fr` width, and as they reach `150px` wide each, they will start to flow onto the same line.

With `auto-fit`, any completely empty tracks will collapse to `0` and the filled tracks will grow to take up their space. However, if you change this to `auto-fill`, empty tracks will take up the same amount of space they would do if filled:

  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr));
}
```
