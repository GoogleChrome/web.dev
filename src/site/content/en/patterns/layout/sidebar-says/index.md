This demo takes advantage of the [minmax()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/minmax) function for grid layouts. In the demo this function is used to set the minimum sidebar size to `100px`, but on larger screens, letting that stretch out to `25%`. The sidebar will always take up `25%` of its parent's horizontal space until that `25%` becomes smaller than `100px`.

Add this by using the `grid-template-columns` property with the following value:
`minmax(100px, 25%) 1fr`. The item in the first column (the sidebar in this case) gets a `minmax` of `100px` at `25%`, and the second item (the `main` section here) takes up the rest of the space as a single `1fr` track.

```css/2
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(100px, 25%) 1fr;
}
```
