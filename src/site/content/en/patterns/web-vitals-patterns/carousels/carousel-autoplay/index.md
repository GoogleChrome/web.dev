This carousel uses [CSS scroll snap](https://web.dev/css-scroll-snap/) to create
smooth, performant slide transitions that do not cause [layout
shifts](https://web.dev/debugging-layout-shifts/).

This carousel can be navigated in a variety of ways: in addition to navigation
controls, it supports keyboard navigation and swiping. To maximize usability and
readability, the carousel stops auto-transitioning once the user mouseovers
within the carousel area.
