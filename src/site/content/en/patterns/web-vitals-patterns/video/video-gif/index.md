Animated GIFs can be 5-20x larger than the equivalent MP4 video. However, MP4
videos can be configured to look and feel like GIFs by including the `autoplay loop
muted playsinline` attributes on the `<video>` tag. In addition, to prevent
layout shifts, make sure to set the `width` and `height` attributes. For
instructions on converting GIFs to MP4, see [Create MPEG
Videos](https://web.dev/efficient-animated-content/#create-mpeg-videos).
