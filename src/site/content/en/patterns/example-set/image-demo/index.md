It is possible to use an image (static or animated) as a demo in a CodePattern.

Use an `Img` shortcode wrapped in a `<figure>` tag in the demo.md
file. In this case, you should **not** add *body.html* to the demo assets.
If you still want to display an HTML snippet, give it a name other than "body".

<!--
  Remove the following code if you're creating your own image demo.
  It's just here for you when _reading_ the site to see example of what you'd put in index.md.
-->

```html
// demo.md
