Slide transitions are the most common source of carousel-related layout shifts. In a non-autoplay carousel these layout shifts typically occur within 500ms of a user interaction and therefore do not count towards Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). However, for autoplay carousels, not only can these layout shifts potentially count towards CLS - but they can also repeat indefinitely.
