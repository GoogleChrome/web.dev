  Media files are a bit like onions. The file that you see in your operating
  system shell is only a container with multiple data streams and different
  allowable types of encodings.

To support multiple browsers, you'll need to use FFmpeg to convert your `.mov`
file to two different containers: an MP4 container and a WebM container. In
actual practice, you would likely specify a codec at the same time. For now,
we're letting FFmpeg use its defaults.

If these concepts are new to you, you should read
[Media file basics](/media-file-basics/#containers-and-codecs-and-streams)
before going further. Additionally, if you don't have FFmpeg installed read
[Media application basics](/media-application-basics/#installing-applications-with-docker)
to get it set up with Docker.

**We are using the suggested Docker install and
the [glocken.mov] file from [Prepare media files for the web](/prepare-media/)
added inside the `media` directory. We used FFmpeg version 4.3.2 for all the
commands in this section.**

{% Aside 'caution' %}
If the commands don't work for your version of FFmpeg, consult the FFmpeg
documentation.

## Containers

First, we need to create our two containers from the `.mov` file with the `.mp4`
and `.webm` file extensions with both an audio and video stream inside the file.
Review [Media file basics](/media-file-basics/#containers-and-codecs-and-streams)
for more about containers and streams if you don't know the different between
them.

1. MP4

    ```bash
    /media # ffmpeg -i glocken.mov glocken.mp4
    ```

1. WebM

    ```bash
    /media # ffmpeg -i glocken.mov glocken.webm
    ```

WebM takes longer to create than MP4. This isn't surprising when you look at
the results. While MP4 compresses to about `83%` of the original file's
size, WebM is down to `78%` of the original's size, but can be much smaller.
Your results will vary. It's important to call out that FFmpeg `4.2.2` set the
default video bitrate to `200k` and in `4.3.2` it does not set a default bitrate.
So the video is no longer  **a mere`4%` of the original**. You can see this for yourself
using the `ls -a` [bash command] in the folder where your media files are located.

For example:

```bash
/media # ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 root  root  12080306 Mar 7 12:16 glocken.mov
-rwx------ 1 root  root  10106446 Mar 7 12:33 glocken.mp4
-rwx------ 1 root  root   9503301 Mar 7 18:30 glocken.webm
```

To get a tiny file, you would do this instead:

```bash
/media # ffmpeg -i glocken.mov -b:v 200k glocken.webm
...
frame=  300 fps=3.6 q=0.0 Lsize=     483kB time=00:00:10.01 bitrate= 395.0kbits/s speed=0.121x
video:359kB audio:117kB subtitle:0kB other streams:0kB global headers:0kB muxing overhead: 1.356068%
/media # ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 root  root  12080306 Mar 7 12:16 glocken.mov
-rwx------ 1 root  root  10106446 Mar 7 12:33 glocken.mp4
-rwx------ 1 root  root    494497 Mar 7 18:45 glocken.webm
```

### Check your work

To verify your results, use FFmpeg and Shaka Packager as already shown in
[Media Application basics](/media-application-basics):

```bash
/media # packager input=glocken.mp4 --dump_stream_info
```

```bash
/media # ffmpeg -i glocken.mp4
```

## Codecs

Next, the codec. As stated in [Media file basics](/media-file-basics), a codec
is _not_ the same thing as a container (file type). Two files of the same container
type could hold data compressed using different codecs. The WebM format for example
allows audio to be encoded using either [Vorbis] or [Opus]. To change the codec we
use FFmpeg. For example, this command outputs an `.mkv` file with a `vorbis` audio
codec and an `av1` video codec.

```bash
/media # ffmpeg -i glocken.mov -c:a vorbis -c:v av1 glocken.mkv
```

In this example, the `-c:a` flag and the `-c:v` are for specifying the audio and
video codecs respectively.

The [Media conversion](/media-conversion/#change-characteristics) page lists
commands needed to convert codecs. The tables below summarize the libraries used
in FFmpeg to perform the codec conversions for WebM and MP4 files. These are the
formats recommended for DASH and HLS respectively.

### Video

| Codec | Extension    | Library    |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------- |
| av1   | WebM, mkv    | libaom-av1 |
| h264  | MP4          | libx264    |
| vp9   | WebM         | libvpx-vp9 |

### Audio

| Codec  | Extension | Library    |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| aac    | MP4       | aac        |
| opus   | WebM      | libopus    |
| vorbis | WebM      | libvorbis  |

Next, we'll show you how to change the [bitrate](/bitrate/) of your newly created files.
