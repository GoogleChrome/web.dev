title: Containers and codecs
description: |
  Media files are a bit like onions. The file that you see in your operating
  system shell is only a container multiple multiple data streams and different
  allowable types of encodings.

## Change the container

To support multiple browsers, you'll need to use FFmpeg toconvert your mov file
to two different containers: an mp4 container and a webm container. In actual
practice, you would likely specify a codec at the same time. For now, I'm
letting FFmpeg use its defaults.

```bash
ffmpeg -i glocken.mov glocken.mp4
```
{% Aside %}
To create this article, I used FFmpeg version 4.2.2-tessus. If the command
lines don't work for your version of FFmpeg, consult the FFmpeg documentation.
{% endAside %}

Webm takes quite a bit longer to create than mp4. This isn't surprising when
you look at the results. While mp4 compresses to about a quarter of the original
file's size, webm is down in the single digits, though results may vary.

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 jmedley  eng  12080306 Apr 21 13:13 glocken.mov
-rw-r--r-- 1 jmedley  eng  10146121 Apr 21 13:25 glocken.mp4
-rw-r--r-- 1 jmedley  eng    491743 Apr 21 13:30 glocken.webm
```

## Check your work

This is a good place to remind you that you can verify the results of these
tasks using the same applications you're using to do the work. Remember that, as described in
[Application basics](../application-basics), you'll need both FFmpeg and Shaka
Packager since neither shows you everything.

```bash
packager input=glocken.mp4 --dump_stream_info
```

```bash
ffmpeg -i glocken.mp4
```

## Codecs

Next the codec. As stated earlier, a
codec is _not_ the same thing as a container. Two files of the same container
type could hold data compressed using completely different codecs. The webm
format for example allows audio to be encoded using either
[vorbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis) or
[opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)). To change the codec I
use FFmpeg.

In the last section I demuxed the audio and video like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i glocken.webm -vcodec copy -an glocken_video.webm
ffmpeg -i glocken.webm -acodec copy -vn glocken_audio.webm
```

If I need to change the audio and video codec, I would replace the `copy` keyword
with the name of a codec. For example, this command outputs an audio fileËœ
encoded with the aac codec.

```bash
ffmpeg -i glocken.webm -c:a vorbis glocken.m4a
```

The [cheat sheet](/web/fundamentals/media/manipulating/cheatsheet#codec) lists
commands needed to convert codecs. The tables summarize the libraries used in
FFmpeg to perform the codec conversions for webm and mp4 files. These are the
formats recommended for DASH and HLS respectively.
