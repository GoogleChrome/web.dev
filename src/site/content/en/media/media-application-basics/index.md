Much media work requires changing characteristics of media files, such as
bitrate or resolution. Finding a straightforward way to get started can be
bewildering and intimidating. On this page, I provide an onramp into that
world.

You'll notice in what follows that the word 'resolution' doesn't appear. What
the two applications output are just the dimensions, the numbers themselves.
That's because resolution is just an informal shorthand for the dimensions of a
video. In every case that follows, I talk about specific numbers.

This page describes the basic usage for two common command-line media utilities: [Shaka
Packager](https://github.com/google/shaka-packager) and
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Why cover two applications? While
both are powerful and useful by themselves, neither does everything needed to
prepare media for the web. I've also created a [cheat sheet](/media-cheat-sheet) showing
common operations with those applications.

These aren't the only options available for many file manipulation tasks. But
they are two of the most common and powerful. Other options include the GUI
applications [Miro](http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/),
[HandBrake](//handbrake.fr/), and [VLC](//www.videolan.org/). There are also
online encoding/transcoding services such as
[Zencoder](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zencoder) and [Amazon Elastic
Encoder](//aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder).

## Shaka Packager

[Shaka Packager](https://github.com/google/shaka-packager) is a free media
packaging SDK. If you were using a media player on your site, Shaka Packager is
what you would use to prepare the files. It supports conversion for the two most
common video streaming protocols: [Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
(DASH)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/DASH_Adaptive_Streaming_for_HTML_5_Video)
or [HTTP Live Streaming
(HLS)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming). Shaka
Packager supports key security features: common encryption and Widevine digital
rights management (DRM). It can also handle live video, and
video-on-demand. Those concepts are beyond the scope of this article.

Despite what it says on the package, this utility is for more than C++
developers. You can use it as both a library for building media software and as
a command-line utility for preparing media files for playback. It's the latter
capacity that's useful for us here. In fact, for web media creators, Shaka Packager
is the only way to do some tasks without spending money on expensive commercial
applications.

Here's the basic pattern for a Shaka Packager command:

```bash
packager stream_descriptor [stream_descriptor-2 [stream_descriptor-n]] [flags]
```

This isn't quite what you get if you type `packager -help`. This is how I think
of it, and this reflects the examples in the [Shaka Packager
documentation](https://google.github.io/shaka-packager/html/). Note that there are multiple
`stream_descriptor` items in the pattern. Though I don't show it, you could
manipulate the video and audio streams of a file directly.

Compare this basic pattern with a simple use that displays file characteristics.
In the example, I've lined up equivalent parts.

```bash
packager stream_descriptor [stream_descriptor-n] [flags]

packager input=glocken.mp4                       --dump_stream_info
```

The command outputs this:

```bash
[0416/140029:INFO:demuxer.cc(88)] Demuxer::Run() on file 'glocken.mp4'.
[0416/140029:INFO:demuxer.cc(160)] Initialize Demuxer for file 'glocken.mp4'.

File "glocken.mp4":
Found 2 stream(s).
Stream [0] type: Video
 codec_string: avc1.640028

```

Look for the characteristics discussed in [Media file basics](/media-file-basics) and
notice a few things. The height and width are correct for full HD, and the audio
and video codecs are among the preferred codecs for their container types, AAC
for audio and H264 for video. Notice also that streams are identified with
numbers. These are useful for operations that manipulate the audio and video
separately.

Notice that the output above doesn't show the bitrate. Despite what's missing,
this output is easier to read, so I use it whenever I can. When I need
information that Shaka Packager can't get, such as the bitrate, I use FFmpeg.

## FFmpeg

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) is also a free application for
recording, converting, and streaming media files. Its capabilities aren't better
or worse than Shaka Packager's. They're just different.

The basic pattern for an FFmpeg command looks like this:

```bash
ffmpeg [GeneralOptions] [InputFileOptions] -i input [OutputFileOptions] output
```

Like Shaka Packager this application can handle multiple streams. Some of its
options are used in multiple locations and have different effects on file output
depending on where they are in the command. Be aware of this as you look at
[FFmpeg questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ffmpeg)
and similar sites.

I'll again compare the basic pattern to the example for displaying file characteristics.

```bash
    ffmpeg [GeneralOptions] [InputFileOptions] -i input        [OutputFileOptions] output

    ffmpeg                                     -i glocken.mp4
```

In additon to the information I requested, this also prints an error message as
shown in the example below. That's because this is technically an incorrect
usage of FFmpeg. I use it because it displays information I care about.

```bash
Input #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'glocken.mp4':
  Metadata:

    Metadata:

    Metadata:
      handler_name    : SoundHandler
At least one output file must be specified
```

Now that you've tried your hand at using Shaka and FFmpeg, it's time to [Prepare media files for the web](/prepare-media).
