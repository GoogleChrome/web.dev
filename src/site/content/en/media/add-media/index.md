In this section you'll learn how to embed a media file in a web page using the
`<video>` and `<source>` tags, and how to add captions to a video for the
hearing-impaired.

This section assumes you have an audio or video file that is ready for embedding
in a web page. An mov file straight off a camera will not work. If an mov file
is all you have, see [Prepare media files for the web](/prepare-media) then come back.

This section covers two topics.

* In [The &lt;video> and &lt;source> tags](/video-and-source-tags) you'll
  learn specifically how to embed a media file in a web page.
* In [Accessibility with the &lt;track> tag](/media-accessibility) you'll
  learn to add captions to a media file for hearing impaired.

{% Aside %}
Be sure not to skip the accessibility section. The technical aspects of
supporting accessibility are not that difficult. They are also a regulatory or
legal requirement in many places.
