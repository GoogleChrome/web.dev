You might think that you can take a video camera and upload it to the web as is.
Indeed, video streaming sites such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or
[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) let you do this. These sites simplify video
processing and uploading for the sake of customer service. Preparing a video for
serving from your own site is a bit more complicated.

Video files come in a variety of formats. The format that comes off your camera,
typically a `.mov` file, is good for recording and for editing and other early
post-production processes. Its size means it's not good for streaming over the
web. Because browsers support different file formats, you'll need to create
multiple files. Before converting files you need to understand a few basics
about them and about their characteristics.

The file that you see in your operating system shell is a _container_,
identified by a file extension (`.mp4`, `.webm`, etc.). The container houses one or
more _streams_. A media file can have any number of streams, of [more
types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats) than I will
go into here.

The sample files used later in this section contain at most two streams: an
audio stream and a video stream. Among the other types you might encounter are
captions and data, both of which are beyond the scope of this article. There are
instances where audio and video streams are dealt with separately. Most files
you'll encounter will only contain a single audio stream and a single video
stream.

Within the audio and video streams, the actual data is compressed using a codec.
A _codec_, or coder/decoder, is a compression format for video or audio data. The
distinction between a container and a codec is important because files with the
same container can have their contents encoded with different codecs.

The image below illustrates this structure. On the left is the basic structure.
On the right are the specifics of that structure for a single WebM file.

Not all browsers support up-to-date containers and codecs. For example, WebM is
high-quality and open source. Files in WebM packages can be orders of magnitude
smaller than other formats, making them a good choice for mobile download.
Although WebM was created specifically for the web, its support is not yet
universal. Safari in particular does not, as of this writing,
[support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webm) WebM for embedded video.

All modern browsers support MP4 files, making them a good general choice for a
media container and the best choice as the backup container for WebM.

Many file formats support multiple codecs for the same container type. A
complete list of available [video
codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs)
and [audio
codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs)
would be a whole website itself. The links just provided are for MDN's practical
lists of what's usable on the web. Listed below are the currently preferred file
types and the codecs they may use. Follow the links for browser support lists.

| File type | Video Codec | Audio Codec |
| ---- | ----- | ---- |
| [MP4](https://caniuse.com/#search=mp4)  | [AV1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs#AV1), [AVC (H.264)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs#AVC_H.264)*, [VP9](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs#VP9) | [aac](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs#AAC) |
| [WebM](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webm) | [AV1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs#AV1), [VP9](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs#VP9)* | [vorbis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs#Vorbis), [opus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs#Opus) |
&#42; Indicates the the preferred video codec.

_Bitrate_ is the maximum number of bits used to encode one second of a stream.
The more bits used to encode a second of stream, the higher the potential
detail and fidelity.

_Resolution_ is the amount of information in a single frame of video, given as
the number of logical pixels in each dimension. I provide more information about this
concept in [Resolution](/resolution).

In [Media application basics](/media-application-basics/), I'll show you how to examine
these characteristics using two command line tools: Shaka Packager and FFmpeg.
