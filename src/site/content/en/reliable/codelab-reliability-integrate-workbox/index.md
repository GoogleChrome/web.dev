In the previous sections you learned how to use
[Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) to add precaching to
a sample app. In this section you'll learn how to incorporate Workbox into the
build process so that it updates the list of project assets to be precached each
time you update your code.

{% Aside %}
If you've finished previous sections of this project in your own Glitch, you
can continue working in it. Otherwise, you can use the Glitch provided here.
{% endAside %}

To add Workbox to the build process, modify the `start` script in `package.json` so `workbox
injectManifest` is run each time files are updated:

```js/3
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "workbox injectManifest && node server.js"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Open the logs console by clicking __Tools > Logs__:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./glitch-logs-btn.png"
  style="max-width: 356px;" alt="A screenshot of the Glitch tools menu.">
</figure>

Make an update to any file in the `public/` directory and verify in the logs
console that Workbox has run:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./glitch-console.png" alt="A screenshot of the
  Glitch console showing that Workbox has run.">
</figure>

Refresh the page to verify that the service worker updated the precache with the
 modified file.
