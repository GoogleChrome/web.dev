Congratulations! You completed the reliability codelab and learned how to use a
Workbox-powered service worker to enhance the user experience. You learned to:

+  Register and install a service worker
+  Use WorkBox to modify an existing service worker and precache essential
   application assets
+  Integrate Workbox into the build process
+  Use Workbox to handle navigation requests
+  Implement runtime caching to cache external assets on demand
+  Add offline fallback functionality
+  Access and modify caches from the client
+  Give users control over what is cached

You can learn more about Workbox and see additional demos at the
[Workbox website](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/).
