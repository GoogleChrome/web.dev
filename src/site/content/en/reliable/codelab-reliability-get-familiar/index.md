In this project you'll learn several techniques for making web applications
more resilient. As you move through the sections of the project, you'll build
out an existing sample application by adding a service worker that will improve
the experience when the user is offline or has limited connectivity. The sample
app will let users download Wikipedia articles for viewing offline. It has
three sections (or views):
1.  __Home:__ displays a welcome message.
1.  __Cached:__ displays a list of cached Wikipedia articles available for
offline viewing. (Starts out blank. You'll implement this later.)
1.  __Settings:__ displays information about the app (e.g., storage usage,
  network status) and allows users to clear storage. (You'll implement this
  later.)

There's also a search feature that lets users query the Wikimedia REST API. (You'll
implement this too.)

The sample app is built as a
[single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
using an [application shell](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell)
architecture. (The application shell is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that
powers the user interface.) Most of the app has been written for you, except
for the service worker and a few methods in `app.js` that you'll write as you
move through the project.

## Relevant files

Client
+  `public/index.html` is the static app shell HTML. It contains several
   `section` elements that act as content placeholders.
+  `public/app.js` populates the placeholder elements in the HTML with content
   from Wikipedia and toggles the visibility of different sections based on
   user actions.
+  `public/styles.css` contains all of the CSS needed to style the app.
+  `public/offline.partial.html` is a partial view that will be used as a
   fallback response when the network is unavailable. (More about this in
   [Create an offline fallback](../codelab-reliability-offline-fallback/).)
+  `src/service-worker.js` starts empty but will contain the service worker
   code you'll write for this project.

Server
+  `server.js` contains logic that serves static files from the `public` and
   `dist` directories and calls the Wikimedia REST API to fetch and return rendered
   Wikipedia articles to the client.
+  `workbox-config.js` starts empty but will contain the configuration options
   to use the [Workbox CLI](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli)
   to inject a [precache manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching#explanation_of_the_precache_list)
   into your service worker file.

## The app in action

You can use Chrome DevTools to see how the app shell architecture affects
requests:
+  In Glitch, click __Show__ and then select __In a New Window__ to view the
   live version of the sample app.

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./show-live-btn.png" style="max-width: 347px;"
  alt="A screenshot of the Glitch Show Live button.">
</figure>

+  Open Chrome DevTools by pressing `Control+Shift+I`  (or `Command+Option+I`
   on Mac).
+  Click the __Network__ tab and reload the page.

You should see the app shell assets load:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./app-shell-assets.png" alt="A screenshot
  of Chrome DevTools showing that the app shell assets have loaded.">
</figure>

Two things to notice as you navigate between sections in the sample app:
+  No further requests are made to the network; since this is a single page
  application, JavaScript is updating the UI without making requests for
  additional pages.
+  The URL pathname is updated using the
   [Window History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/history).
   This is handled by `app.js`, which contains logic to render the view that
   corresponds to the current pathname.

For example, if you click the __Settings__ tab, `app.js` will toggle the
visibility of the "Settings" section and update the location bar's pathname
to `/settings`:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./settings-section.png" alt="A screenshot
  of the sample app's Settings section.">
</figure>

Now try out the search functionality by clicking __Search__
<img src="./icon-magnifying-glass.svg" alt="Magnifying glass icon."
style="max-width: 20px; vertical-align: text-top;">
and entering a search term (e.g., "Miami"). You'll see that the page is
populated with content from Wikipedia. To make that work, the following events
take place between the browser and server:

1. The app makes a
[`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) request
to the server for the article, using a request URL in the format
`/api/wiki/pageTitle`, where `pageTitle` is replaced with the search term (in
  this case `/api/wiki/Miami`). Any spaces in the title will be replaced with
  underscores (e.g., "New York" â†’ `/api/wiki/New_York`)

1. The server responds to the API call by fetching the relevant Wikipedia page
using the Wikimedia REST API. Before returning the rendered HTML to the client,
`server.js` makes a few modifications to the article, as discussed later.
That's why requests to the Wikimedia REST API are processed server-side instead of
contacting the Wikimedia REST API directly from the client page.

1. The client receives the HTML text response and populates the `articleContainer`
element:

    ```js/3-6
    // fetch Wikipedia page by title
    async function fetchWikiPage(title) {
      // ...
      const response = await fetch(encodeURI(`/api/wiki/${title}`));
      const html = await response.text();
      // ...
      articleContainer.innerHTML = html;
      // ...
    }
    ```

1.  Most Wikipedia articles contain images, which will show up as additional
network requests:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./image-requests.png" alt="A screenshot
  showing the sample app's network requests for Wikipedia images.">
</figure>
