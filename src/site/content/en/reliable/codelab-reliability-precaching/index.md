In the previous section you learned how to create a service worker using
[Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/). In this section
you'll learn how to use Workbox to add precaching to your service worker.

{% Aside %}
If you've finished previous sections of this project in your own Glitch, you
can continue working in it. Otherwise, you can use the Glitch provided here.
{% endAside %}

Precaching makes it possible to serve cached files to the browser without going
to the network, which makes the app accessible offline. The general rule is to
precache any HTML, JavaScript, or CSS that's loaded early on and is crucial to
displaying the basic structure of a given page. In this app, it makes sense to
precache all the critical app shell files in the `public/` directory.

The easiest way to precache files with Workbox is to use its command line
interface (CLI). The
[Workbox CLI](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli)
has two primary modes:
+  `generateSW`: generates a complete service worker for you.
+  `injectManifest`:iInjects the the project assets that you want to precache
   into an existing service worker file.

{% Aside %}
If you want to use other service worker features (e.g., web push), import
additional scripts, or add additional logic to your service worker, `generateSW`
probably isn't the best choice. Instead, consider using `injectManifest`,
which provides more control over your service worker.
{% endAside %}

{% Aside %}
Is `workbox-cli` the right choice for your build process? If you have an
existing build process that is based entirely on npm scripts, then
`workbox-cli` is a good choice. If you're currently using webpack as your build
tool, the
[`workbox-webback-plugin`](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin)
is a better choice.
{% endAside %}

This project will use the `injectManifest` mode, which uses options specified
in the Workbox config file `workbox-config.js`, discussed below. (A full list
  of available options can be found here.) Based on these options Workbox:
+  Looks for a specific string (`precaching.precacheAndRoute([])` by default)
   in your source service worker file,
+  Replaces the empty array with a list of URLs to precache, and
+  Writes the service worker file to its destination location.

The rest of the code in your source service worker is left untouched.

You can use Workbox in `injectManifest` mode by running the following command:

```
workbox injectManifest workbox-config.js
```

To get started:

1. Add the following options to `workbox-config.js`:

    ```js/2-7
    const path = require('path');
    module.exports = {
      swSrc: path.join('src', 'service-worker.js'),
      swDest: path.join('dist', 'service-worker.js'),
      globDirectory: './public/',
      globPatterns: [
        '*.{html,js,css}'
      ]
    };
    ```

    A quick explanation of the options:

    +  `swSrc`: the path to the source service worker file that contains your
       custom code.
    +  `swDest`: the path and filename of the service worker file that will be
       created by the build process.
    +  `globDirectory`: the base directory that contains the files to be precached
       (For the sample app, the base directory is `public/`.)  
    +  `globPatterns`: the patterns that define what files will be included in the
       precache manifest (Here, the `html`, `js`, and `css` file extensions have
       been specified, so `index.html`, `offline.partial.html`, `app.js`, and
       `styles.css` will be matched.)

1. Add the line `workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([]);` to
   `service-worker.js`:

    ```js/4
    // ...

    workbox.core.skipWaiting();

    workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([]);
    ```

1. Next open the developer Glitch console by clicking __Tools > Full Page Console__:

    <figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
      <img class="w-screenshot" src="./glitch-console-btn.png"
      style="max-width: 356px;" alt="A screenshot of the Glitch console button.">
    </figure>

1. Run the following command in the console to invoke the `injectManifest`
   module:

    ```
    workbox injectManifest workbox-config.js
    ```

    You should see the following message, indicating that a service worker has
    been written to `dist/service-worker.js`:

    ```
    Using configuration from /app/workbox-config.js.
    The service worker was written to dist/service-worker.js
    4 files will be precached, totaling 30.5 kB.
    ```

    If you don't see `service-worker.js` in the `dist/` directory, run the
    following command in the Glitch console to refresh the visual filesystem:

    ```
    refresh
    ```

1. Open and inspect `dist/service-worker.js`. You should see that a precache
   manifest list has been injected into your service worker, with the remainder
   of the service worker left untouched:

    ```js
    // ...
    workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([
      {
        "url": "app.js",
        "revision": "225a3b50beff884b6b0382367cd39da2"
      },
      {
        "url": "index.html",
        "revision": "c267d5f79131f190d2b157eb9c98137a"
      },
      {
        "url": "offline.partial.html",
        "revision": "46c20898f3d0f9c78b56834287a47d4a"
      },
      {
        "url": "styles.css",
        "revision": "aab5b6d2737656fcfd813373178afd10"
      }
    ]);
    // ...
    ```

The injected array includes all files that the service worker will precache.
Each object in the array contains a `revision` attribute, which is used as
versioning information by Workbox to track and update precached resources that
have been modified. If a URL/revision combination in the manifest changes, a
service worker knows that the previous cached entry is no longer valid, and
needs to be updated.

To see how Workbox's versioning works, copy the `revision` attribute for
`app.js` so you can reference it later. Then add a comment anywhere in the
`app.js` file and run Workbox again from the Glitch console:

```
workbox injectManifest workbox-config.js && refresh
```

Look at `dist/service-worker.js` to verify the `revision` attribute for
`app.js` has changed:

```js/5/4
// ...
workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([
  {
    "url": "app.js",
    "revision": "225a3b50beff884b6b0382367cd39da2"
    "revision": "879b834765f0c7c7ce4b72f877b29ad6"
  },
  // ...
]);
// ...
```

Now you're ready to see precaching in action. Modify `server.js` to serve the
generated service worker file from the `dist/` directory (instead of the
`src/` directory):

```js
// route for service worker
app.get(/service-worker\.js/, function(request, response) {
  response.sendFile(__dirname + `/dist/service-worker.js`);
});
```

Navigate to the app and refresh the page. You should see the service worker
fetch and precache the app shell files in the precache manifest.

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./precached-files.png" alt="A screenshot of
  Chrome DevTools showing the precached files.">
</figure>

{% Aside %}
Workbox appends a special \_\_WB_REVISION__ URL query parameter to URLs that
need revision information. If a URL already contains version information (e.g.,
a hash value), Workbox's build tools will detect it and exclude a revision
field.
{% endAside %}

Workbox should provide a message in the console confirming that four files have
been precached:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./precache-confirmation.png" alt="A screenshot
  of the Chrome DevTools console showing a message confirming that four files
  have been precached.">
</figure>

To verify that these files are cached locally, navigate to the __Application__
tab in DevTools. In the __Cache Storage__ panel, you should see a new cache
named `workbox-precache-...`, which is the default cache name used by Workbox
for precached files. View the contents of the cache by clicking the cache name:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./cache-contents.png" alt="A screenshot of
  Chrome DevTools showing the contents of workbox-precache.">
</figure>

Now return to the __Network__ tab and refresh the page to verify that the
assets are now served from the cache by the service worker. The __Size__ field
will indicate if resources were returned from the service worker. Workbox
should also provide a message in the console that these resources were returned
from the precache:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./resources-returned-precache.png" alt="A
  screenshot of Chrome DevTools console showing messages indicating which
  resources were returned from the precache.">
</figure>

Now you're ready to see the app work offline:

+  Select the __Offline__ checkbox in the __Network__ tab of DevTools:

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./offline-checkbox.png" alt="A screenshot of
  Chrome DevTools showing the Offline checkbox.">
</figure>

+  Refresh the page

Congratulations, you've just added offline functionality to your app!
