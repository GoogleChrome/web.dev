If you've finished the previous sections of this project, you've built a sample
app that allows users to search for and view previously cached Wikipedia
articles offline. That feature is somewhat useful, but it's not an ideal: what
if your user doesn't remember what articles they've already viewed? A better
experience would allow users to view the list of articles that are available
offline.

To create that experience, in this section you'll learn how to access a web
app's caches to display a list of cached assets.

If you've finished previous sections of this project in your own Glitch, you
can continue working in it. Otherwise, you can use the Glitch provided here.

The [Cache Storage API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/cache-api)
is available for use in both service workers and in the context of window
clients. So, if you want to make changes to caches—like adding or removing
entries, or getting a list of cached URLs—from the context of your web app, you
can do so directly without having to communicate with a service worker.

To allow users to view and access cached articles in the sample app, you can
refer to the Wikipedia articles cache name `wiki-api` to get a list of entries
in that cache. To do that create a `queryWikiCache()` method in `app.js` to
query the `wiki-api` cache using the Cache Storage API. For each article in the
cache, use the `createArticleThumbnail(title)` method to create an article
list item based on the article's title and append each list item to the
`articleHistoryContainer` DOM element.

```js/3-15/2
// query cache and populate cached articles list
async function queryWikiCache() {
  // TODO: add logic to query articles cache and display cached articles
  articleHistoryContainer.innerHTML = '';
  const wikiCache = await window.caches.open(WIKI_API_CACHE);

  wikiCache.keys().then(keys => {
    if (keys.length > 0) {
      keys.forEach(key => {
        let title = key.url.toString().match(/api\/wiki\/(.*)/)[1];
        articleHistoryContainer.appendChild(createArticleThumbnail(title));
      });
    } else {
      articleHistoryContainer.innerHTML = `<p><i>No articles cached</i></p>`;
    }
  });
}
```

Refresh the page and navigate to the __Cached__ tab in the sample app to see the
list of cached Wikipedia articles viewable offline!

<figure class="w-figure w-figure--center">
  <img class="w-screenshot" src="./article-list.png" alt="A screenshot
  showing the list of cached articles in the sample app.">
</figure>

Note that the trash icons in the article list aren't functional yet. You'll
add this functionality in the next section!
