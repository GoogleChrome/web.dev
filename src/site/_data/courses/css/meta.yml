# The date is used to organize the courses on the /learn page.
# This should be the initial publish date of the course. When new pages are
# added to the course the site will check if they are <30 days old, and if they
# are, it will give them a "New" badge. However, when you first launch a course
# you don't want every entry to have a "New" badge, so anything that existed
# on or before this date will not receive the "New" badge.
