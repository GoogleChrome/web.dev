overview:
  en: When you're building a modern web experience, it's important to measure, optimize, and monitor if you're to get fast and stay fast. Performance plays a significant role in the success of any online venture, as high performing sites engage and retain users better than poorly performing ones. Sites should focus on optimizing for user-centric happiness metrics. Tools like Lighthouse (baked into web.dev!) highlight these metrics and help you take the right steps toward improving your performance. To "stay fast", set and enforce performance budgets to help your team work within the constraints needed to continue loading fast and keeping users happy after your site has launched.
