You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals">web-vitals.js library</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-vitals/ahfhijdlegdabablpippeagghigmibma?hl=en">Web Vitals extension</a> to see individual Core web Vitals in the wild.',

    answer: 'Core Web Vitals prescribe a specific set of metrics thresholds and percentiles we believe correspond well to user expectations across a range of devices. We encourage using our official thresholds as much as possible. If however, you would like to set custom targets for thresholds (e.g an LCP performance budget of < 3s), this is possible using Lighthouse CI and LightWallet.

  },
  {
    category: 'Web Vitals',
    question: '#webdevLIVE how do you get field values and how do you get lab values for core web vitals?',

    question: 'Does on-scroll animation give a bad CLS score?',
    answer: 'The CLS metric excludes layout shifts if there was user input within 500ms of the shift. However, scrolling is not considered "user input" for the purposes of calculating CLS, so scroll-driven animations could give a bad CLS if not implemented properly (e.g. animating/transitioning the `transform` property, which does not cause layout shifts). As always, the best way to know for sure is to test your page and see if your scroll-driven animations are causing an increase in CLS.',

    category: 'Performance',
    question: '#webdevLIVE if Search Console shows your CLS as high, but using Page Speed Insights & Lighthouse look great for the example Url, what could be going on?',
    answer: 'There is some nuance to how PageSpeed Insights (PSI) and Search Console report on Cumulative Layout Shift. The lab portion (Lighthouse) of PSI measures CLS until Lighthouse considers a page fully loaded. Search Console and the field portion of the PSI uses Chrome UX Report data and measures CLS until unload, stopping reporting after pagehidden. What this means is that the reporting you see in different tools can vary based on the window of time we are able to look at. Lab tools like Lighthouse have to define a shorter window because they are focused on the experience during page load and optimize for delivering information about the experience quickly. Field data is able to take a more holistic view of the user-experience, which could include shifts caused after a page has loaded and the user has scrolled down to other interactions contributing to CLS. See the detailed answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62682709/why-does-cumulative-layout-shift-differ-between-pagespeed-insights-and-search-co/62682710#62682710">here</a>.',
