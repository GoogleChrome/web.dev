Online stores need efficient and accurate product search.

Well designed search is a prime source of engagement and conversion: 'searchers'
are [far more likely to convert](https://www.bigcommerce.co.uk/blog/ecommerce-site-search/#your-on-site-search-optimization-checklist)
than 'browsers'.

Conversely, many people [will abandon a site and probably never return](https://baymard.com/blog/mobile-ecommerce-search-and-navigation)
after a poor search experience.

In this series of guides and codelabs you'll learn to help customers find what
they want — and help lead them to additional products.
