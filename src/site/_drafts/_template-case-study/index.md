<!--
 # General guidelines:
 #
 # Case study eligibility criteria: go/web-partner-showcase (restricted to Googlers)
 #
 # You're writing this case study because you want to persuade a senior technical or business leader
 # to make some sort of change in their company. These people are **busy**. Your case study should
 # follow the inverted pyramid model [1] and should be as short as possible (probably less than 500 words).
 #
 # Avoid subjective statements as much as possible. Just let the data speak for itself.
 #
 # [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)

<!--
 # Follow the prompts below to create a well-structured case study. If you re-arrange the content, your
 # review will take longer and web.dev will be less likely to publish your case study.
-->

<!--
 # Summarize in 1 to 5 sentences what kind of changes were made and what kind of improvements were achieved.
 # You'll probably want to use the Stat component: https://web.dev/handbook/web-dev-components/#stats
 #
 # DON'T START WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY! That's not the most important information.
 # If readers only take away one thing from this post, we want it to be the change + improvement.
 # Furthermore, the change + improvement is the "hook" that persuades people to read the rest of the post.

<!--
 # A general note for you, the author: how confident are you in the
 # partner's data, and our interpretation of the data?
 # Your name (and reputation) will be associated to this post.
-->

<!--
 # Now you can summarize the website/company in 1 to 3 sentences.
 # Think about the kind of leader that you want to persuade. Use words that
 # will capture their attention and make them realize that this post is relevant
 # to them.
-->

<!--
 # Go into more detail about the changes, if necessary. Make sure to link out to relevant
 # documentation as much as possible.
-->

<!--
 # What were the main challenges? How did the website/company solve each challenge?
 # You can do a section to discuss each challenge/solution in-depth.
-->

<!-- You can provide more information about the website/company at the bottom of the post, if needed. -->
