Include a self-assessment in your post using this short code:

{% Assessment page, 'my-first-self-assessment' %}

Rename the file and the shortcode argument
so it conveys the topic of your assessment.

Then populate the `your-assessment-topic.assess.yml` file in your post's
folder following the patterns in
`_template-self-assessment/my-first-self-assessment.assess.yml`.
