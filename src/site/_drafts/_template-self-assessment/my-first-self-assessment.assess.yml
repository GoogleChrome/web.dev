    stem: When is it appropriate to lazy load an image?
    options:
      - content: When the image is offscreen during initial page load.
        rationale: |
          Images that are offscreen during page load aren't initially needed
          and so can be lazy loaded to improve performance.
      - content: When the image is a PNG or JPG.
        rationale: |
          Improve performance by lazy loading all images—not just PNGs and
          JPGs—that aren't needed when the page loads.
      - content: When the image has a `lazyload` class.
        rationale: |
          The `lazyload` class is something _you_ add to tell
          lazysizes which images to lazy load.
          You can't use the class to determine
          which images you _should_ lazy load.
      - content: When the image is larger than 10&nbsp;KB.
        rationale: |
          Lazy load any image that may improve performance
          without hurting user experience, regardless of how big the file is.
