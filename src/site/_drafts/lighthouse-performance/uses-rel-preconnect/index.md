The Opportunities section of your Lighthouse report lists all URLs
requested later in the page load.
Consider using <link rel=preload> to prioritize fetching resources
that are currently requested later in page load:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="uses-rel-preconnect.png" alt="Preconnect to required origins">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” Preconnect to required origins
  </figcaption>
</figure>
