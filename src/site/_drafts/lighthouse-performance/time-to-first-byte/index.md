The Opportunities section of your Lighthouse report
identifies the time at which your server sends a response:

<figure class="w-figure">
  <img class="w-screenshot w-screenshot--filled" src="time-to-first-byte.png" alt="Server resonse times are low (TTFB)">
  <figcaption class="w-figcaption">
    Fig. 1 â€” Server response times are low (TTFB)
