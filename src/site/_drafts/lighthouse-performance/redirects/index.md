## How to fix impacts of redirects on page load

When a browser requests a resource that has been redirected, the server usually returns an HTTP response like this:

```js
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /path/to/new/location
```
The browser must then make another HTTP request at the new location in order to retrieve the resource. This additional trip across the network can delay the loading of the resource by hundreds of milliseconds.

Update the links to these resources.
The links should point to the current locations of the resources,
so that the redirects are eliminated.
It's especially important to avoid redirects in resources that are required for your Critical Rendering Path.

If you're using redirects to divert mobile users to the mobile version of your page,
consider re-designing your site to use Responsive Design.
