Users of screen readers and other assistive technologies need information
about the behavior and purpose of controls on your web page.
Built-in HTML controls like buttons and radio groups
come with that information [built in](/use-semantic-html).
For custom controls you create, however, you must provide the information with
[ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)
roles and attributes.
(Learn more in the
[Introduction to ARIA](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/).)
