## About ARIA

The [Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria)
(WAI-ARIA, or just ARIA)
is good for bridging areas with accessibility issues that can't be managed with native HTML.
It works by allowing you to specify attributes that modify the way an element is translated into the accessibility tree. 

Using ARIA attributes,
you can give the element the missing information so the screen reader can properly interpret it.
In order for these attributes to be effective,
they need to make sense-- you wouldn't want a screen reader
to misinform a user.

[Introduction to ARIA](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/semantics-aria/).
