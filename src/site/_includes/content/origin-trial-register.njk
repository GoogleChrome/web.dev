1. [Request a token]({{origin_trial.url}}) for your origin.
2. Add the token to your pages, there are two ways to provide this token on
   any pages in your origin:
     * Add an `origin-trial` `<meta>` tag to the head of any page. For example,
       this may look something like: <br>
       `<meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="TOKEN_GOES_HERE">`
     * If you can configure your server, you can also provide the token on pages
       using an `Origin-Trial` HTTP header. The resulting response header should
       look something like: `Origin-Trial: TOKEN_GOES_HERE`
