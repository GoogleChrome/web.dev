Various template engines can be extended with custom tags.

Custom Tags are unrelated to Eleventy's Collections using Tags feature.
Unfortunately we've inherited this name from various upstream template
languages.

Custom Tags give us the ability to write components similar to Eleventy's
Shortcodes but with much more power because they have full access to the
page context and the parser.
