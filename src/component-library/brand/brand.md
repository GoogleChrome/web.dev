The brand block is designed to add control to the web.dev brand and provide an opportunity to have a supporting byline. Gutter is set on the block for if you apply a [layout composition](https://web.dev/design-system/css-compositions/).

In the samples, [the cluster](https://web.dev/design-system/css-compositions/#cluster) is used to display the byline inline, where space allows.
