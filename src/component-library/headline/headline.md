A heading tag (`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>` etc) should **always** be used in a heading
context. Sometimes, the default, global CSS for a specific heading tag isn't
appropriate though.

The headline pattern has no specific CSS block, but instead, overrides the core
global CSS with utility classes to help you maintain the correct aesthetic _and_
semantic hierarchy.
