All form field styling is applied to the native HTML element itself as global
CSS, rather than using a class. For checkboxes and radio buttons, the [cluster
composition](/design-system/css-compositions/#cluster) is used to provide the
basic layout.

It's recommended that you use the `rows` attribute on a `<textarea>`, but if you
don't, a minimum height will be applied.
