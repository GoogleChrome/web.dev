The aside pattern controls its own space when in a [flow context](/design-system/css-utilities/#flow)
to guarantee there's enough vertical space.

You can style it using [theme utility classes and/or token utility classes](/design-system/colors).
These are generally applied to the aside itself, its title, its icon and its
body. All of these are optional.
