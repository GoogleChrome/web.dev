Add a `data-icon-only` [exception](https://cube.fyi/exception.html) to always visually hide the label, regardless of viewport size.

Just like with the [button](/design-system/component/button), you can add a `primary` or `secondary` `data-type` to set a theme.

To dock the FAB at the bottom right of the screen, add `data-docked` to it.
