Use the Stats component to call out important statistics about a product or
service discussed in a post. (Stats are primarily used in case studies.)

You can modify the look and feel of stats by using utility classes that
reference [theme colors](/design-system/colors#theme-usage). It's recommended
that you add these theme classes to the root, `.stats` element.
