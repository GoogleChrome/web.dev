You can add the `.button` class to either `<button>` _or_ `<a>` elements.

To apply a different type, set a `data-type` attribute with either `primary` or `secondary` as the value.

You can also add icons by adding an `<svg>` as a child item of the button. If you add an icon, you should wrap the label in an element such as a `<span>` so the margin rules can affect it.
