Use the markup below to create a table.
Do _not_ use Markdown syntax;
it doesn't include the wrapper element needed
to ensure correct whitespace around the table.

If you want content in `<td>` elements to be vertically aligned
to the top of the cell, add the `w-table--top-align` class
to the `<table>` element.

Tables scroll when their width is larger than that of the content column.
