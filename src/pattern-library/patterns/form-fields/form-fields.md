## Specific notes

### Checkboxes

The [Newsletter](/newsletter) page uses a new material styled checkbox. You can use it simply and easily by just adding the class `w-chechbox` to an `input[type=checkbox]` element. However to align a label to to the checkbox you'll want to wrap the label and checkbox in a `div.w-display--inline-flex` element, and add the `w-ml--l` class to the label.
