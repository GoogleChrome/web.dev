# web.dev

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/web.dev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/web.dev)

web.dev is the ultimate resource for developers of all backgrounds to learn,
create, and solve on the web. It's meant to not only educate developers, but
help them apply what they've learned to any site they work on, be it personal or
business.

Note: this repo contains the written content for web.dev. The client-side JS and
server are not yet open source.

## Authoring content

[Our wiki](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/wiki) provides docs on
authoring guides and codelabs.

## Get started

### Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev.git --recurse-submodules
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** We're currently in the process of open sourcing our CSS.
Unfortunately the above command will only work for folks who are part of our
team and have access to the styles submodule. We plan to resolve this in
the second half of May. Thank you for your patience! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Install dependencies.

```
npm ci
```

### Compile docs into the `dist` directory.

```
npm run build
```

### Start a local server to preview the site.

Changes to assets will rebuild the site. Refresh to see changes.

```
npm run dev
```

Next,  open `http://localhost:8080/` to see the site locally. The preview server
allows you to see how the content will look on the production site, but it's
not a true staging server. For example, features like search and JS components
may not work or be entirely broken on the local preview.

### Pull latest styles

```
git submodule update --remote
```

## Staging

Stage the site to App Engine.

```
npm run stage
```

‚òùÔ∏èYou'll need to be a member of the App Engine project to run this command.

Preview the site at
[https://web-dev-staging.appspot.com](https://web-dev-staging.appspot.com)

## Debugging

The easiest way to debug the site is to add a `debugger` statement to
`.eleventy.js`, then run `npm run debug`, and go to `chrome://inspect` to
attach to the running process.
