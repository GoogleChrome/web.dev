/**
 * @file This outputs an .eleventyignore file in the root of the project.
 * This is used to tell eleventy to ignore large sections of the docs in order
 * to speed up build times.
 *
 * By default this will ignore most files on the site. You can use the
 * ELEVENTY_INCLUDE=[] environement variable to pass a JSON string of
 * directories that should be included in the build.
 *
 * Example .env file:
 * ELEVENTY_IGNORE=true # ignore most of the site
 * ELEVENTY_INCLUDE=["fast", "accessible"] # build /fast and /accessible
