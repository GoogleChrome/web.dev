# Lazy Load Offscreen Images with lazysizes

Lazy loading is the strategy of waiting to load resources until they are needed, rather than loading them in advance. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of resources that need to be loaded and parsed on initial page load.

Images that are offscreen during the initial pageload are ideal candidates for this technique. Best of all, [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) makes this a very simple strategy to implement.

---

## 1. Add the lazysizes script to the page

- Add the following `<script>` tag to `index.html`:

```html
<script src="lazysizes.min.js" async></script>
```

(Note: The [lazysizes.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aFarkas/lazysizes/gh-pages/lazysizes.min.js) file has already been added to this project, so there is no need to add it separately.)

lazysizes will intelligently load images as the user scrolls through the page and prioritize the images that the user is going to encounter soon.

## 2. Indicate the images to lazy load

- Add the class `lazyload` to images that should be lazy loaded. In addition, change the `src` attribute to `data-src`.

For example, the changes for `flower3.png` would look like this:

**Before:**
```html
<img src="images/flower3.png">
```

**After:**
```html
<img data-src="images/flower3.png" class="lazyload">
```

For this example, we recommend lazy loading `flower3.png`, `flower4.jpg`, and `flower5.jpg`.

<div class="aside note">
You may be wondering why it is necessary to change the `src` attribute to `data-src`.

If this attribute is not changed, all the images will load immediately instead of being lazy-loaded. `data-src` is not an attribute that the browser recognizes, so when it encounters an image tag with this attribute, it doesn't load the image. In this case, that is a good thing, because it then allows the lazysizes script to decide when the image should be loaded, rather than the browser.

## 3. See it in action

That's it! To see these changes in action, follow these steps:

- Click on the "Show Live" button to view the live version of the the Glitch.

- Open the console and find the images that were just added. Their classes should change from `lazyload` to `lazyloaded` as you scroll down the page.

- Watch the network panel to see the image files load individually as you scroll down the page.

## 4. Verify using Lighthouse

Lastly, it's a good idea to use Lighthouse to verify these changes. Lighthouse's "Defer offscreen images" performance audit will indicate if you've forgotten to add lazy loading to any offscreen images.

- Click on the "Show Live" button to view the live version of the your Glitch.

- Run the Lighthouse performance audit (Lighthouse > Options > Performance) on the live version of your Glitch and verify that the "Defer offscreen images" audit was passed.

Success! You have used lazysizes to lazy load the images on your page.
