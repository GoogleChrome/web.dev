title: Fast load times
blurb: Learn how to guarantee your site loads quickly.
overview: |

    When you're building a modern web experience,
    it's important to measure, optimize, and monitor
    if you're to get fast and stay fast.
    Performance plays a significant role in the success of any online venture,
    as high performing sites engage and retain users better than poorly performing ones.
    
    Sites should focus on optimizing for user-centric happiness metrics.
    Tools like Lighthouse (baked into web.dev!) highlight these metrics and
    help you take the right steps toward improving your performance.
    To "stay fast", set and enforce performance budgets
    to help your team work within the constraints needed to continue loading fast
    and keeping users happy after your site has launched.
