# Using Lighthouse CI to set a performance budget

You‚Äôve done hard work to get fast so let‚Äôs make sure you stay fast! Let‚Äôs automate performance testing with [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/ebidel/lighthouse-ci).

Lighthouse grades your app in 5 categories, and one of those is performance.
While you could try to remember to monitor performance changes with
[DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools) or
[Lighthouse CLI](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#cli) every
time you edit your code, you don‚Äôt have to do that. Tools can do the tedious
stuff for you. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is a great service that
automatically runs tests for your app in the cloud every time you push new code.


Lighthouse CI integrates with Travis, and its performance budget feature ensures
that you won‚Äôt accidentally downgrade performance without noticing. If the
Lighthouse scores for a pull request fall below the threshold you‚Äôve set (e.g. <
80/100), **Lighthouse CI will prevent that pull request from being merged**:

Although you can test performance on localhost, your site will often perform
differently on live servers. To get a more realistic picture, it‚Äôs best to
deploy your site to a staging server. You can use any hosting service, and in
this guide, we‚Äôll be taking [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) hosting for
a spin.

## 1. Setup

We are working with a simple app that helps you sort three numbers. 

[Clone the example from
GitHub](https://github.com/mihajlija/lighthouse-ci-starter/), and make sure to
add it as a repository on your GitHub account.


## 2. Deploy to Firebase

To get started, you‚Äôll need a Firebase account. Once you‚Äôve taken care of that,
[create a new project in the Firebase
console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) by clicking "Add project":

![Firebase console](./firebase-console.png)

### Deploying to Firebase

You'll need [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/) to deploy the
app. Even if you already have it installed, it's good practice to frequently
update the CLI to the latest version by running:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
npm install -g firebase-tools
</pre>

Authorize the Firebase CLI by running:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
firebase login
</pre>

Now initialize the project:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
firebase init
</pre>

The console will ask you a series of questions during setup:

- When prompted to select features, choose "Hosting."
- For the default Firebase project, select the project that you‚Äôve created in
  the Firebase console.
- Type in "public" as your public directory.
- Type "N" (no) to configuring as a single-page app.

This process creates a `firebase.json` configuration file in the root of your
project directory.

Congrats, you‚Äôre ready to deploy! Run:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
firebase deploy
</pre>

In a split second, you‚Äôll have a live app. 

## 3. Setting up Travis

You‚Äôll need to [register an account](https://travis-ci.com) on Travis and then
activate GitHub Apps integration under the Settings section of your profile.

### Once you have an account 

Go to Settings under your profile, hit the Sync account button, and make sure
your project repo is listed on Travis.

To kick-off continuous integration, we need two things:

1. To have a `.travis.yml` file in the root directory

2. To trigger a build by doing a regular old git push
We've already prepared the following `.travis.yml` YAML file in the `lighthouse-ci-starter` repo.
<pre class="prettyprint">
language: node_js
node_js:
 - "8.1.3"
install:
 - npm install
before_script:
 - npm install -g firebase-tools
script:
 - webpack</td>
</pre>


The YAML file tells Travis to install all the dependencies and build your app. Now it‚Äôs your turn to **push the example app to your own GitHub repository**.  If you haven't already, run the following command:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">git push origin master</pre>

Click on your repo under Settings in Travis to see your project's Travis dashboard. If everything is cool, you‚Äôll see your build go from yellow to green in a couple of minutes. üéâ

## 4. Automate Firebase deployment with Travis 

In Step 2, we logged into our Firebase account and deployed our app from the command line with `firebase deploy`. In order for Travis to deploy our app to Firebase, we have to authorize it. How do we do that? With a Firebase token. üóùÔ∏èüî•

### Authorize Firebase

To generate the token run this command: 

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">firebase login:ci</pre>

It will open a new tab in a browser window so that Firebase can verify you. After that, look back at the console, and you‚Äôll see your freshly minted token. Copy it and go back to Travis.

In your project's Travis dashboard, go to More options > Settings > Environment variables. 

<img class="screenshot" src="./travis-environment-variables.png" alt="Travis environment variables">

Paste the token in the value field, name the variable `FIREBASE_TOKEN`, and add it.

### Add deployment to your Travis setup

We just need the following lines line to tell Travis to deploy our app after every successful build. Add them to the end of your `.travis.yml` file. üîö

<pre class="prettyprint">
after_success:
   - firebase deploy --token $FIREBASE_TOKEN --non-interactive
</pre>


Let‚Äôs push this change to GitHub and wait for our first automated deployment. If you take a look at your Travis log, it should soon say ‚úîÔ∏è Deploy complete!

Now whenever you make new changes to your app, they will be automatically deployed to Firebase.

## 5. Setting up Lighthouse CI 

Lighthouse CI has its very own friendly bot that updates you on your app‚Äôs
Lighthouse scores. It just needs an invitation to your repo.

On GitHub, go to your project‚Äôs settings and **add "lighthousebot" as a collaborator** (Settings>Collaborators):

<img class="screenshot" src="./lighthouse-bot-collaborator.png" alt="Lighthouse bot collaborator status">

Approving these requests is a manual process so they don't always happen
instantly.  Before you start testing, make sure lighthousebot has approved its
collaborator status. In the meantime, you also need to add another key to your
project's environment variables on Travis. [Leave your email
here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIc3QNIMn7bBMgl2cfxmmo6wGBlUpdLGxjB_ml464t9eCg_A/viewform),
and the Lighthouse CI key will be delivered to your inbox. üì¨

On Travis, add this key as an environment variable and name it `LIGHTHOUSE_KEY`:

<img class="screenshot" src="./lighthouse-api-key.jpg" alt="Add Lighthouse API
key on Travis">

<div class="aside note">
You can reuse this same key for other projects.
</div>

### Add Lighthouse CI to your project

Next, add Lighthouse CI to your project by running:

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy"> npm i --save-dev https://github.com/ebidel/lighthouse-ci</pre>


And add this bit to your `package.json`:

<pre class="prettyprint">
"scripts": {
  "lh": "lighthouse-ci"
}
</pre>


### Add Lighthouse CI to your Travis configuration

For our final trick, let‚Äôs test the performance of our app after every pull
request!

In `.travis.yml` add another step in after_success:

<pre class="prettyprint">
after_success:
 - firebase deploy --token $FIREBASE_TOKEN --non-interactive
 - npm run lh -- https://staging.example.com
</pre>

It will run a Lighthouse audit on the given URL, so replace https://staging.example.com with the URL of your app (that‚Äôs your-app-123.firebaseapp.com).

We‚Äôve set our standards high and won‚Äôt accept any changes to the app that bring the performance score lower than 95. Let‚Äôs tweak our setup to include that:

<pre class="prettyprint">
- npm run lh -- --perf=95 https://staging.example.com 
</pre>


### Make a pull request to trigger Lighthouse CI on Travis

Lighthouse CI will only test pull requests, so if you push to the master branch
now, you‚Äôll just get "This script can only be run on Travis PR requests" in your
Travis log.

To trigger our Lighthouse CI test, let‚Äôs make a pull request.

Checkout a new branch, push it to Github, and make a pull request. Hang tight on
that pull request page and wait for the Lighthouse bot to sing! üé§

<img class="screenshot" src="./lighthouse-scores.png" alt="Lighthouse scores">

<img class="screenshot" src="./github-checks.png" alt="Github checks">

Our performance score is great, we are under budget, and the check has passed! 

### More Lighthouse options

Remember how Lighthouse tests 5 different categories? You can enforce scores for
any of those with Lighthouse CI flags:

```shell
--perf  # performance
--pwa   # progressive web app score
--a11y  # accessibility score
--bp    # best practices score
--seo   # SEO score
```

Example: 

<pre class="prettyprint devsite-terminal">
npm run lh --perf=93 --seo=100 https://staging.example.com
</pre>

This will fail the PR if the performance score drops below 93 **or** the SEO
score drops below 100. 

You can also choose not to get Lighthouse bot‚Äôs comments with the `--no-comment`
option.
