                web.dev is the ultimate resource for developers of all
                backgrounds to learn, create, and solve on the web. It's meant
                to not only educate developers, but help them apply what they've
                learned to any site they work on, be it personal or business.
              </p>
              <p>
                web.dev was borne of a belief that if we make high quality
                experiences easy to build, it will enable more meaningful
                engagement on the web—for users and developers alike. Simply
                put, we realized the only way the web gets better is if we help
                the people building it succeed.
              </p>
              <p>
                And the web can be better.

              <p>
                While we have a fantastic, creative community, there are 
                <a href="https://httparchive.org/">indicators</a>
                that the web we experience daily does not map to its current
                capabilities. We, Google's web platform team, are looking to work
                together with developers to help close that gap.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because no platform can match the reach of the web. But the benefit
                of this massive reach is offset if the experience can't meet user
                expectations. As the bar for high-quality experience continues to
                rise, users are quickly disappointed in a web experience that
                doesn't deliver. And then they're gone.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe, however, the web now has the capabilities to overcome
                that challenge—to give all users the best possible experience
                wherever they are.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now we want to help the developer community build that kind of web.
                With our deep understanding of user needs and working closely with
                partners who've seen great results, we've created guidance and tools
                here that developers of all stripes can explore, try, and deploy.

              <p>
                We discovered the web is its most capable when certain core
                principles are met. We've identified those tenets of a successful
                web experience so you can now execute against them to better meet
                your users' needs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Reach</em> potentially every user on the web by being
                  <strong>discoverable</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Engage</em> your users by building <strong>fast</strong>,
                  <strong>smooth</strong> experiences across devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Retain</em> them with <strong>reliable</strong> experiences
                  that work at the same speed regardless of network connection,
                  while keeping them in a <strong>safe</strong> and
                  <strong>accessible</strong> environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Convert your audience to loyal users by building in meaningful
                  <strong>capabilities</strong> based on your use case.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2 class="no-link">
                Businesses following these principles today are already seeing
                positive results.

                By building a modern web experience focused on performance and high
                quality UX and capabilities, Pinterest made their mobile web
                platform the top channel for new sign-ups, a key conversion metric
                for the business.
