                Whether you already have a website or you're just getting
                started, learn to build for the modern web at web.dev. Then,
                apply your new skills and solutions to any personal or
                professional site you work on.
              </p>
              <p>
                After you've launched your site, come back to web.dev and
                measure how well it supports your users. If there are areas
                where it can improve, you'll get immediate steps to increase
                your metrics.
              </p>

                As the web advances, users' expectations get higher. With
                web.dev's guidance, you can give your users the best possible

              <p>
                You know your users, and you have solutions for their needs.
                But, to win your users' loyalty, you also need to give them the
                best possible experience with your site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make sure your audience can:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Find your site
                </li>
                <li>
                  Open your site from any device
                </li>
                <li>
                  Load your site on a poor network connection
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use your site with assistive technology, like a screen reader
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                While these principles seem basic, there's a lot of room for
                improvement across the web. With web.dev, you can see how your
                website is performing, and learn tips to improve your user
                experience.

                At first, Pinterest's mobile site pushed all their users to
                download their app. Then, they invested in building a modern web
                experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a new focus on speed and performance, Pinterest's mobile
                site became more engaging to their users. Now, the mobile web is
                their top channel where new users sign up to join Pinterest.
