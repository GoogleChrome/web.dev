Review your Lighthouse audit below and see detailed guidance on how to improve it.

Demo instructions:

1. Be sure to **Sign In** above.

1. If you don't see scores below, use 'Inspect Element' to find the `web-profile` element.
   Type `$0.addInterestUrl('https://nu.nl')`.
   After a few seconds, the scores should display for the site you've added.
   Right now, you can only add scores for sites [from here](https://webdev-dot-lighthouse-ci.appspot.com/).
